It was reported that he expressed a desire to step down, but King Abdullah asked him to stay on for as long as he is around.

The country is currently in the grip of one of its worst power crises in years due to a shortfall in imported oil, with the situation exacerbated Sunday by an attack on a key powerline in restive Balochistan province. Moody's said that increasing energy imports without addressing structural issues that create so-called circular debt ""will further strain Pakistan's budget and balance of payments, a credit negative"". ""Fuel shortages also reflect the strained finances of state-owned distribution companies and the fuel importer, Pakistan State Oil corporation, and are a setback to the sector's progress on reforms made so far under Pakistan's financial support program with the International Monetary Fund.""The IMF granted a $6.6-billion loan to Pakistan in September 2013 on the condition that it carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.Moody's, which in July 2014 upgraded Pakistan's rating outlook from ""negative"" to ""stable"" in a boon for the shaky South Asian economy, said that structural reforms had been a ""key driver"" in its decision last year. ""Circular debt"" -- brought on by the dual effect of the government setting low electricity prices and customers failing to pay -- is at the heart of the crisis. State utilities lose money, and cannot pay private power generating companies, which in turn cannot pay the oil and gas suppliers, who cut off the supply. The fuel crisis began last week when Pakistan State Oil was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of the country's oil. The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the pumps. But Moody's warned that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, which made solving the energy crisis a key campaign pledge, had so far failed to offer policy solutions and increasing oil supplies would only add to the fiscal burden. ""The government's targeted fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in fiscal 2015 from 4.7 percent in fiscal 2014 is already impeded by delays in implementing electricity tariff adjustments and legal challenges related to tax collections,"" it said.

Islamic finance is experiencing a revival in Pakistan, aided by an ambitious five-year plan that regulators hope will double the industry's share of the banking sector to 20 percent by 2020.A growing client base and improving asset quality helped Islamic banks post profits before tax of 12 billion rupees ($119.1 million) in the third quarter of last year, almost double the year-earlier amount, central bank data shows. But regulators want to tackle consumer perceptions that Islamic banks falter when it comes to social responsibility and ethical banking practices.The average financing-to-deposit spread - the difference between what banks charge for financing and what they pay their depositors - for all lenders, Islamic and conventional, remains high and should be ""reasonably rationalised"", central bank governor Ashraf Wathra said in a speech to a gathering of industry executives on Monday. He did not specify a satisfactory level, but singled out Islamic banks as the ones needing to reward customers in line with a rise in profits.""Banks were advised to come up with their own solutions or the SBP will apply sharia-compliant measures to address the issue,"" said Wathra. He did not elaborate, but in the past the central bank has prescribed minimum targets for banks to lend to specific sectors of the economy such as agriculture and small business. Islamic banks follow religious principles which ban the charging of interest and gambling, and stress the sharing of risk and profits. The industry has developed a range of sharia-compliant financial tools, some with greater profit-sharing qualities than others. Islamic banks fall short when it comes to using strongly profit-sharing instruments such as musharaka, whose share of overall Islamic financing in Pakistan was only 10.1 percent as of September, compared to 4.2 percent a year earlier. Musharaka is a partnership in which two or more parties agree to provide capital, sharing both profits and losses according to a stipulated ratio. By contrast, murabaha - a cost-plus-profit arrangement where one party agrees to buy merchandise for another - commands the lion's share of financing by the country's Islamic banks, at 30.3 percent.

The Guardian, along with other news outlets, cited documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) via Le Monde.HSBC said that its Swiss arm had not been fully integrated into HSBC after its purchase in 1999, allowing ""significantly lower"" standards of compliance and due diligence to persist.The Guardian alleged in its report that the files showed HSBC's Swiss bank routinely allowed clients to withdraw 'bricks' of cash, often in foreign currencies which were of little use in Switzerland, marketed schemes which were likely to enable wealthy clients to avoid European taxes and colluded with some to conceal undeclared accounts from domestic tax authorities.HSBC said the Swiss private banking industry, long known for its secrecy, operated differently in the past and this may have resulted in HSBC having had ""a number of clients that may not have been fully compliant with their applicable tax obligations.""Its private bank, especially its Swiss arm, had undergone ""a radical transformation"" in recent years, it said in a detailed four-page statement.HSBC's Swiss private bank was largely acquired as part of its purchase of Republic National Bank of New York and Safra Republic Holdings, a US private bank.HSBC said the number of accounts in its Swiss private bank had fallen from 30,412 in 2007 to 10,343 at the end of last year and it was cooperating with authorities investigating tax matters.The data was supplied by Herve Falciani, a former IT employee of HSBC's Swiss private bank. HSBC said Falciani downloaded details of accounts and clients at the end of 2006 and early 2007. French authorities have obtained data on thousands of the customers and shared them with tax authorities elsewhere, including Argentina.Switzerland has charged Falciani, who Reuters was unable to reach for comment, with industrial espionage and breaching the country's secrecy laws.

Shortly before the New York market closed, the world powers and Iran said that Tehran has agreed to curtail its nuclear program in return for the lifting of US and European Union nuclear-related sanctions that have harmed its economy.Lifting sanctions could open up the flow of Iranian crude to an oversupplied global market.

Investment in government securities touched new peak as such a high IDR level has never been achieved previously.Though yields on the government papers are falling (7pc on T-bills and 8-9pc on PIBs), an anticipation of further cut in discount rate pushes banks to lock-in funds in PIBs on high returns.Since November 2014, the cumulative discount rate has been reduced by 200 basis points following low inflation and positive outlook on external sector.The government is not firmly agreed with the analysts' view that banks are not interested in extending private sector loans and parking their whole money into the government papers.The government in its latest letter of intent to the IMF said, 'Private sector credit continued its healthy expansion (10.2 percent so far in FY15) driven mainly by businesses, and in particular manufacturing.'Some analysts foresee bank lending to start expanding in coming quarters. Within different financing segments, a moderate pickup is expected in consumer loans.The State Bank, with the help of World Bank experts, has developed a comprehensive National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) to implement financial sector reforms to meet their financing needs.

But he has embraced it as an opportunity for Italy to show the world that it is reinventing itself under his leadership.The event plays to Italy's strengths with its nutrition and gastronomy-based theme of ""Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life.""Organisers are predicting 20 million visitors over six months and a 10-billion-euro boost to economic activity through increased tourist revenues and other, harder to measure, benefits such as increased investment.More than a million Chinese are expected to visit Milan for the Expo and Italian officials are hoping some of them will become long-term business partners as the economic relationship between the two countries flourishes.For Milan, the Expo is also about reinvention with the city seeking to forge a new image as a 21st Century ""smart"" city that is defined as much by its flair for gastronomy, design and sustainable living as by its industrial past.There will be tight airport-style security around the site and a huge police presence on Friday in anticipation of the ""No Expo"" movement's march.Earlier this week, police carried out pre-emptive raids on radical groups suspected of planning to ensure the demonstration turns into a showdown with the security forces.Officers seized fireworks, baseball bats, gas masks and material which could be used to make Molotov cocktails.The organisers of Friday's demonstration have insisted it will be peaceful and accuse the police and media of whipping up public alarm because they are fearful that there will be more people protesting than visiting the Expo.The Expo's critics have focused on the conditions of some of the 6,000 employees who have been engaged on a work experience basis, as well as the involvement of corporations such as McDonalds and Coca Cola, saying that has stripped the event of any environmental credibility.",5/1/15,hopes and fears as milan expo opens door,,,133,"London: Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday as the market seeks to build on strong gains in April following massive falls earlier in the year.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in June won 56 cents to $59.49 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for June won 47 cents to stand at $66.93 a barrel in London midday deals.After slumping at the start of the year, oil prices rose by about a fifth in value during April owing to several factors including concerns about unrest in Yemen, the weakening dollar and fewer US rigs in operation, analysts said.However, prices remain well down after plunging almost 60 percent between June and the start of 2015 on the back of a global supply glut and ramped up production.""Crude oil producers in the US have significantly cut back output in an attempt to address the significant supply overhang which has exerted downward pressure on... prices since June last year,"" Kash Kamal, senior research analyst at Sucden brokers said on Tuesday.The International Monetary Fund has said that Gulf oil exporters must reduce spending, including subsidies, and diversify their economies to cope with lower revenues caused by the sharp drop in crude prices.The wealthy monarchies, however, should ""not react in a knee-jerk way to lower oil prices"", the IMF Middle East and Central Asia chief Masood Ahmed told AFP in an interview Monday.""Saudi Arabia seem committed to defending their market share and have even increased output to over 10 million barrels per day in April,"" said Kamal.""Support for higher crude prices has partly come from a weaker dollar,"" he added.A weaker dollar makes oil priced in the US unit cheaper for holders of others currencies, boosting demand.

But as oil prices have dropped lower than budgeted breakeven levels, ""it is important that they gradually, but in a determined way... reduce their spending (and) consolidate their fiscal position,"" Ahmed said.Oil prices have shed half of their value since June 2014, and are expected to be lower than the breakeven point for Gulf countries in the next three to four years.The Gulf Cooperation Council includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- economies all heavily dependent on energy revenues. A combined budget surplus for 2014 of $76 billion (68.5 billion euros) is expected to turn into a deficit of $113 billion this year, the IMF said in its latest regional report. ""They need to act to reinforce their efforts to diversify their economies to become less dependent on oil,"" said Ahmed, pointing out that many have already taken such measures.""The UAE is more advanced in terms of diversification. The others also are in varying degrees trying to encourage private sector activity outside the oil area."" - Curb subsidies -GCC countries were also urged to cut energy subsidies in a bid to minimise public spending and trigger a change in consumer behaviour.""Most GCC countries still have the domestic sale price for energy products below the international prices... We think that over time it is important to tackle the issue of energy subsidies to reduce them,"" Ahmed said.Gulf states should also contain salary growth in the public sector, which usually employs nationals as opposed to the private sector that depends on millions of foreigners.In addition, GCC countries would need to prioritise investment projects that ""most advance the development agenda,"" said Ahmed.Oil-export revenues for GCC countries are forecast to be $280 billion lower this year than a year ago.With the exception of gas-rich Qatar and Kuwait, all GCC states are expected to face budget deficits this year, said Ahmed, adding this could persist for two or three years.""The important thing to recognise is that GCC countries have built up financial buffers that put them in a very strong position to be able to use these savings to finance expenditure and to have a gradual decrease in spending over the coming years,"" he said.This in turn would minimise the economic impact of the drop in oil prices. GCC states are estimated to have foreign reserves of about $2.5 trillion.""The impact on (economic) growth is quite limited,"" said Ahmed.The IMF has forecast GCC countries to grow as a group at 3.4 percent in 2015, one percent down from earlier predictions, mainly because of a slowdown in non-oil growth in response to lower oil prices.",5/5/15,gulf oil exporters should cut spending diversify imf,,,135,"KARACHI: Standard and Poor's on Tuesday revised Pakistan's credit rating outlook from stable to positive and forecast higher GDP growth for 2015 to 2017, amid a stint of economic reforms.In a statement, the agency said the country had made significant progress in stablising its economic, fiscal and external performance, alongside eased financing conditions.'We are therefore revising the outlook on the long term ratings on Pakistan to positive from stable,' the agency said, affirming a B- rating.S&P also revised its earlier average growth estimates for 2015 to 2017 to 4.6 percent from 3.8 percent.This reflected 'strong capital inflows and remittances, and lower oil prices, which support business confidence and investment spending,' it said.Pakistan's GDP grew by 4.1 percent in the fiscal year ending June last year.Net foreign exchange reserves with the central bank reached $12.36 billion dollars in recent weeks from just $3.2 billion in January 2014.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has voiced satisfaction with Pakistan's progress on reforms required under a $6.6-billion bailout agreed in 2013.The loan came on condition that Pakistan ' which was suffering an energy crisis ' would carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.In March, Moody's upgraded Pakistan's dollar bonds rating one notch from stable to positive.Pakistan has been trying to boost its flagging economy since Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was elected nearly two years ago.",5/6/15,sp raises pakistans outlook forecasts higher gr,,,136,"KARACHI: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Thursday announced that the moratorium on KASB Bank Limited has been lifted and it has been merged with BankIslami Pakistan.The SBP spokesman said today that all account holders of KASB can withdraw their money from their branches.

Senator Tahir Hussain Mashhadi of MQM said that the the bill should have been presented in the CCI. He said any tax on natural resources cannot be imposed without consultation of provinces, he said.Senator Nauman Wazir and Sentor Saleem Mandviwala called for need to find a mechansim of gas infrastructure development and suggested that concerns of opposition should also be addressed.Opposition Leader Aitzaz Ahsan and Senators including Usman Saifullah, Mohsin Aziz, Shahi Syed, Saeed Ghani, Usman Kakar, Sassui Paleejo, Robina Adnan, Naseema Ehsan and Mohsin Leghari registered their opposing comments on the bill during discussion.Opposition members belonging to Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Awami National Party (ANP) and Balochistan National Awami Party staged a token walk out from the House.Earlier, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in his winding up speech said National Assembly has already passed the Bill and said the government requires Rs1000 billion annually to maintain and improve gas infrastructure in the country.He said that Rs100 billion would be collated annually through this levy and it would be used for gas infrastructure and added that no province is self-sufficient in gas.He said that the production of gas is 4 BCFD and demand is 8 BCFD adding that it is very necessary to fund some important projects.He said that TAPI is Rs1 trillion project but our share is of Rs100 billion.The minister said that the collection amount of GIDC would not be misused and the parliament would oversee it.Shahid Khaqan said that the CCI itself says that the GIDC does not come into its domain and federal government should settle it. He said that Supreme Court has already decided that it is not a tax but a cess.Defending further the Cess Bill, he argued that to bridge the widening gas supply gap a number of gas import projects were being perused including the Iran-Pakistan (IP) gas pipeline project, Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline project, LNG import projects and LPG supply enhancement project in public as well as private sectors.He said that in case the required infrastructure was not developed for the above mentioned projects the government would be forced to import liquefied fuels which are much costlier as compared to gas.Further Pakistan would also be exposed to payment of liquidated damages or payments. According to him presently neither the federal government nor any gas utility has adequate funding to implement the above project.To create the required infrastructure it was therefore necessary that a new Cess may be imposed.He also accepted the idea of some opposition Senators for forming a committee to point out anomalies in the bill, which would prepare its recommendations to make the bill more beneficial.The minister went on to say that it would be the current government, which has planned to provide gas to every district of Balochistan' APP/Geo News",5/20/15,senate passes gas infrastructure development cess bill amid pr,,,153,"London: Oil prices rebounded Wednesday from recent steep losses in the previous session, as traders awaited the latest snapshot of US crude inventories.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in July rose 59 cents to $58.58 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for July gained 83 cents to stand at $64.85 a barrel in London early afternoon deals.""Prices have bounced back a little following yesterday's 3.0-percent drop,"" said analyst Fawad Razaqzada at trading site Forex.com.""Speculators are exercising some caution ahead of the official supply data today.""Later on Wednesday, the US government's Department of Energy will publish its weekly inventories data for the week to May 15.The US Department of Energy is expected to report stockpiles fell by two million barrels in the week ending May 15, according to Bloomberg News.

Instead, they kept their collective target at 30 million barrels per day -- where it has stood for more than three and a half years.OPEC countries are reported to be actually pumping more than 31 million barrels a day, with the risk of more coming on line.Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at business consultancy firm EY, said prices are ""likely to remain volatile"" ahead of a June 30 deadline for Iran and world powers to come to an agreement on curbing Tehran's nuclear programme.

Iran has the world's fourth-largest oil reserves but its exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million because of the sanctions.

FBR tax collections grew by 12.7 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, which were well below the 17.9 percent growth recorded in Jul-Mar FY14. Overall expenditures grew by 8.3 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, against 8.7 percent in the same period FY14. According to the report, the financing of budget deficit indicates that the government did not resort to inflationary borrowing from SBP; instead, it returned a huge sum of Rs 674.4 billion (on cash basis) during July-March FY15.As a result, the government was not only able to contain its borrowing from SBP within the IMF ceiling for end-March 2015, but also met the limit of zero quarterly borrowing prescribed in the SBP Act, 1956.The report also noted that the real GDP grew by 4.24 percent in FY15. Though it was the highest since FY08, it fell short of 5.1 percent target for the year, as most of the challenges to economic activity continued to persist. Agriculture sector posted a slightly higher growth (2.9 percent) in FY15, compared with 2.7 percent in FY14.

The most popular Corolla 1.3 sedan starts at 1.6 million rupees ($16,000), but buyers have to wait months or pay $1,500 for prompt delivery.The news that Volkswagen was exploring options to enter the Pakistani market has excited car enthusiasts, who are tired of high prices and limited choices.""I think it is a great idea because Volkswagen cars are value for money and reliability,"" said Romano Karim, a fan of the classic Volkswagen Beetles from the 60s and 70s that can often be seen on Pakistan's roads.Haji Mohammad Shahzad, chairman of the All Pakistan Motor Dealers Association, added that having Volkswagen in the market would help drive costs down.""The monopoly of big three could be broken if Volkswagen produces at least 20,000-25,000 cars annually,"" Shahzad told AFP.Renewed confidenceGlobal auto giants are attracted by Pakistan's booming economy, which the International Monetary Fund predicts will grow by 4.5 percent in the next financial year.

They said salaried individuals were a soft target, and by forcing salaried persons for filing returns the tax authorities were trying to achieve their desired number.Earlier, the law required a person earning Rs500,000 per year to file tax return electronically. While salaried persons under threshold for income tax payment, ie Rs400,000 were also required to file returns, but it was not mandatory through e-filing.Muhammad Zubair, President, Karachi Tax Bar Association (KTBA) said the changes made by the FBR are disappointing, as this shows they only want to increase the numbers instead of increasing the tax revenue.He said that a large segment of salaried persons fall in the slab of Rs400,000 to Rs500,000, which also includes the lower cadre of any corporate entity. 'In some cases even a peon of an entity will be filing tax return,' he added.It is pertinent to mention here that a large number of the salaried class already files income tax returns on an annual basis.

Thursday, reducing the reference rate by 1.1 percent from the previous session.The reduction comes after two previous cuts, on Tuesday and Wednesday, sparked concerns that China's economy, long an engine for world growth, is weaker than previously thought.The move fanned fears the Chinese currency could be set for a prolonged depreciation and send shockwaves reverberating through global financial markets.Commodities along with stocks in Europe and Asia fell, safe-havens gold and bonds rose and currencies in Asia-Pacific suffered their worst two-day selloff since 1998.But an afternoon comeback on Wall Street, led by Apple and energy stocks, and news China's central bank had intervened to stop the yuan tanking on Wednesday cheered dealers.The intervention ""is a hopeful sign that

'SBP believes that Pak Rupee will remain stable going forward and may even strengthen depending on the relative movement of international currencies,' said an SBP statement today.On Monday (August 24), financial markets across the globe witnessed turbulence and the panic was most visible in the stock markets. Earlier, the foreign exchange markets also had their share in this global turmoil. Since the start of devaluation of Chinese Yuan on August 11, currency depreciation around the globe particularly in the developing countries has accelerated. Many of these countries have allowed their currencies to depreciate primarily to maintain their trade competitiveness against China. Pakistan is also a part of the global economies and cannot remain immune to the developments around the globe. This fact raised expectations about a possible impact on the domestic economy and a downward movement of the exchange rate. As a result on August 24, 2015 Pak Rupee depreciated against the US Dollar to close at Rs 104.50. This translates into a single day movement of the currency by 2.4 percent and a cumulative depreciation of 2.6% percent since the beginning of this fiscal year. It is important to realise that this positioning is driven by international currency movements and not due to any weakness in the domestic economy. The macroeconomic stability achieved through sustained improvements in economic fundamentals is very much intact and these recent developments do not pose any serious challenge to it.'Our external sector is robust and reserves are at historically high level.'The statement added that, 'Nevertheless it is keenly watching the international economic developments and its impact on our domestic economy. It is also watching the rent seekers who tend to take advantage of such situations and cause damage to the economy by their speculative activities.'

Tax collection in Pakistan is tiny, severely hampering the government's ability to manage its finances. A chronic crisis in the power sector -- made worse by poorly targeted subsidies -- is also a major brake on growth.

The country's annual export size of the commodity stood at 250,000 to 300,000 tons in recent years, he added.Shahjahan said that on an average, some five trucks of onions have been crossing the Wagah border daily to enter into India from Pakistan. Each truck carries some 15 tons of onions.Under these circumstances, prices at Karachi's wholesale market at Super Highway have shot to Rs1,600/40kg of onions from Rs1,000-1,100/40kg a few days ago. Accordingly, the commodity in retail has increased to around Rs40-50/kg from Rs30-40/kg a few days ago.He linked the hike in the prices with the drop in supplies to the market.

The cargo agents' leader said since no government official had contacted them on Wednesday they decided to continue the strike.'Our members are not responsible or liable for any direct or consequential losses suffered by trade due to strike as government has forced our member companies to take the extreme decision to close businesses in protest against the imposition of this unjust tax, which itself means closure of businesses,' he said.An official at a leading terminal operator of Karachi port told The News that the strike had already slowed down the activities.'If this situation persists for another four to five days the goods waiting for clearance will pile up to create menace,' he said. 'And, it will take 20 to 25 days or even more to do clearance in addition to jack up the operational cost for exporters and importers in form of extra port duties.'He added that the government is not realising the fact.Freight forwarders didn't issue any bill of leading for exports and there was no delivery order for lifting the import consignment at terminals. If the situation persists it will create handling issues.Perishable export/import items can be ruined if not cleared on time.The terminal operator said clearing agents and freight forwarders don't work on high turnovers and higher taxes can lead to the closure of their businesses.A leading exporter Jawed Bilwani said government's non-serious attitude to resolve any industry issue is marring trade.

The Gulf emirate's annual Cityscape property fair opened Tuesday with developers foreseeing price declines of about 15 percent this year, yet confident there would be no return to the days when huge projects were abandoned half finished.Scale models of new skyscrapers, sprawling villa compounds and leisure centres, including a new indoor ski slope, were rolled out by several companies.Analysts have signalled a slide in property values, which had recovered significantly in the past two years after shedding half of their value in the 2008 global financial crisis. Dubai had shaken world markets when it signalled that it might default on huge debts incurred after borrowing extensively to build those ambitious projects.Thanks to the robust trade, tourism and transport sectors, the economy has since steadied. ""Residential prices have fallen maybe nine or 10 percent this year,"" said Craig Plumb, Middle East and North Africa research director for Chicago-based investment management company Jones Lang LaSalle.""We expect prices to go down further over the rest of the year,"" saying the decline has ""more to do with what is going on globally. Things like (falling) oil prices and the global nervousness with the Chinese economy slowing.""""The Dubai residential market is very much affected by what's going on in the rest of the world because a large number of people buying here are investors coming from overseas,"" said Plumb.""There is a negative sentiment largely driven by oil prices... It pushed stock prices down and pushed sentiment against the residential market as well.""The city-state, one of seven that make up the United Arab Emirates, is the largest and one of very few markets in the region that has opened up to foreign free-hold ownership. Plumb said prices are likely to fall for 12 more months, while forecasting the drop for this year at 15 percent. London-based property consultancy Knight Frank has reportedly put the annual drop to June at over 12 percent. Cluttons, another London consultancy, expects villa prices to lose up to seven percent in the second half of the year after dropping five percent in the first six months. Signs of price softening had begun to show as a result of strict regulations introduced by UAE financial authorities to avoid a new bubble, including mortgage caps.  In particular, they put a cap on mortgage financing at 75 percent for a first purchase and 60 percent for a second one. This priced out of the market those who could not make down payments of 25 percent or more. As a result, Plumb said, prices are not expected to nosedive as they did in the crisis.  ""We are seeing a much more stable market and that is a sign of better regulation.""Developers undeterredAgainst that background, Cluttons said more than 40,000 units have been announced this year, with in excess of 20,000 to be delivered by 2017. Ziad Chaar, managing director of Dubai developer DAMAC Properties, said ""with 53 billion dirham ($14 billion) recorded transactions in the first six months... we are sure that this market is a good market.""Chaar cited a growing population and healthy economic expansion, including a rising number of tourists and modern infrastructure, in addition to a stable exchange rate and political stability compared with a wider region in turmoil. ""If we did not know that this market is strong, and that there is a very strong demand, we would not have launched these projects,"" he said, pointing to scale models of various luxurious projects. One of the projects on display at Cityscape is Meydan One, which includes plans for the world's highest residential tower, at 711 metres (2,333 feet) high. Dubai is already home to the world's tallest building, Burj al-Khalifa, with stands at 829.8 metres.

'At the end of each month, the circular debt will be maintained below the cap of Rs314 billion. 'The circular debt management plan (or capping mechanism) will include reducing the increase of circular debt (flow) as well as the stock (outstanding amount). Policy induced public sector power entity debt including Power Holding Company Limited (PHCL) debt will be reduced from Rs335 billion to Rs220 billion by 2018. Collection from government customers will be rationalized, and subsidies will be on actual basis and paid according to schedule.' Independent energy experts say the power sector requires just over Rs1 trillion to run itself and if one percent loss appears in the system, it accounts for Rs10 billion. This means the consumers are currently paying over Rs150 billion in the tariff just under the head of losses. However, Nepra, which is supposed to pressurize Discos to bring down losses, has accommodated the inefficient power sector by increasing the losses to 15.3 percent from 13.03 percent. Nepra spokesperson admitted that the regulator had increased the losses of Discos by up to 15.3 percent in the tariff from 13.03 percent insisting that it will add the additional burden of Rs2.1 billion, saying one percent loss means damage of just Rs1 billion that will be recovered from the consumers in the tariff. Nepra had earlier fixed the allowed losses for Discos for 2013-14 at 13.02 percent compared to 18.7 percent. The 5.6 percent difference between determined loss and actual loss accumulated as circular debt of Rs33.6 billion in financial year 2014. Now the regulator for financial year 2015 allowed 15.3 percent compared with expected losses of 18.70 percent, narrowing the gap between allowed and actual losses, but it will still result in accumulation of circular debt of Rs32 billion due to increase in generation. In the short term, there is little that can be done about the flow because the tariffs have been determined. Nepra as a condition of its determinations requires Discos to conduct a study on technical losses to justify the need for increase and to set out future loss reduction initiatives, to be conducted by independent consultants but the results are unlikely to show an effect until financial year 2016 determinations. For the purposes of this circular debt management plan, it is assumed that reductions in losses will reduce the flow of circular debt from Rs32 billion to Rs11 billion. The privatization programme, according to the document, is also likely to reduce excess line losses to the extent of the companies that will be privatized. With expected privatization of three Discos in FY 2016, multi-year tariff (MYT) will have been determined instead of annual tariff determinations and this will give incentives to the new owners to improve losses against the Nepra benchmarks; in any event, the costs of any underperformance will be the responsibility of the new owner.

But the board meeting was cut short when hundreds of striking workers stormed into the airline's headquarters in Roissy, outside Paris.Human resources manager Xavier Broseta ""was almost lynched"", according to one union delegate, and had his shirt ripped off as he clambered over barriers to escape, helped by security guards. CEO Frederic Gagey also made a hasty exit, and the board said the meeting would not resume on Monday.The management condemned the ""physical violence"", and said it would file complaints to the police. Transport Minister Alain Vidalies said the violence was ""unacceptable"". ""They do nothing to advance the search for a solution for Air France,"" he said in a statement.The loss-making airline, which employs 52,000 people, is struggling in the face of fierce competition from global rivals.It had tried to convince pilots, who earn up to 250,000 euros ($280,000) a year, to fly 100 more hours annually for the same salary, but talks broke down last week with pilots saying the plan amounted to an effective pay cut. The French government, which owns a 17.6-percent stake, has criticised the pilots, with Prime Minister Manuel Valls denouncing their ""hardline"" attitude.""If Air France does not evolve then it puts itself in danger,"" Valls said at the weekend.- 'Spectators to a crash' -Four unions announced a strike to coincide with Monday's meeting. It was not clear how many staff were taking part, but the airline said flights would be unaffected beyond some check-in delays. Not all staff support the pilots, who also led a record-long strike a year ago that cost the company nearly half a billion euros.""Ground staff, stewards and hostesses feel they have made enormous efforts without ending up in a position to influence decisions,"" Beatrice Lestic, of the CFDT union, told Le Parisien newspaper. ""They are now spectators to a crash in which they will be the first victims,"" she said.Seeking to sharpen its competitive edge against main European rivals Lufthansa and British Airways-Iberia, the management's new proposals include ending five long-haul routes, reducing the frequency of other flights, and selling 14 planes over the next two years.Although the company says it favours voluntary departures, Gagey has indicated compulsory redundancies may be necessary for the first time, ""otherwise we would not make hoped-for progress in terms of productivity"".Sources at Monday's meeting said the plan includes the possibility of dismissing 300 pilots, 900 air hostesses and stewards, and 1,700 ground staff. The company already shed 5,500 posts via voluntary departures between 2012 and 2014 as it battled competition from low-cost carriers and Gulf airlines. Pilots were also behind a record-long two-week strike in September 2014, which knocked 416 million euros off turnover and was described as ""catastrophic for the French aviation sector"" in a joint statement from key industry unions.The striking pilots opposed the expansion of Air France's low-cost subsidiary Transavia.Air France, which merged with Dutch national carrier KLM in 2004, is trying to cut costs over two years by 1.8 billion euros.A source close to the deal told AFP Monday that as part of its cost-cutting plan, Air France is to enter into discussions about cancelling all or some of the Boeing 787s it has on order.The airline ordered 25 of the 787-9 Dreamliners in 2011.The source said: ""We are going to contact our suppliers from tomorrow to ask them if possible to cancel the scheduled delivery of the 787 planes.""Discussions will be opened and they could end in cancellations, that's our approach.""",10/5/15,air france hr manager almost lynched in job cut pr,,,313,"ATLANTA: Twelve Pacific rim countries sealed the deal Monday on creating the world's largest free trade area, delivering President Barack Obama a major policy triumph.The deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, led by the United States and Japan, aims to set the rules for 21st century trade and investment and press China, not one of the 12, to shape its behavior in commerce to the TPP standards.""After five years of intensive negotiations, we have come to an agreement that will create jobs, drive sustainable growth, foster inclusive development, and promote innovation across the Asia Pacific Region,"" said US Trade Representative Michael Froman.

But learning how to plant seed directly in his fields ' rather than transplanting seedlings, as farmers have for centuries in parched Punjab province ' is helping him manage scarce water better and get a decent crop. Growing rice this way ""requires less labour, less irrigation"", he said. The rice seed is sown straight into moist soil and does not require continuous submergence.So far 30 farmers have applied the improved, water-saving rice cultivation technique on a total of 48 hectares (118.6 acres) in Punjab province. With the traditional method, in contrast, rice seedlings are first cultivated in nurseries for several weeks before being transferred to flooded fields. About a third more water is required through the growing cycle, and the crop takes 15 to 20 days longer to mature. On average in Pakistan, some 3,000 litres of water are used to produce 1 kilogramme of rice, which is the main staple food.But as the country's already scarce water resources dwindle, there is increasing pressure to find more water-efficient growing methods. A recent report from the Planning Commission of Pakistan shows that, in 1951, per-capita water availability was 5,650 cubic metres. By 2010, that figure had plunged to 1,000 cubic metres and is projected to fall to 800 cubic metres by 2025, when the population is expected to hit 221 million.Finding ways to grow more food with less water will be crucial in Pakistan as climate change alters weather patterns, affects monsoon rainfall and reduces groundwater, experts say.Planting rice directly in fields may be one way to keep up food production and help reduce the migration already happening as hard-hit, small-scale farmers give up on their fields and trek to towns and cities in search of other work.INNOVATION BENEFITSMuhammad, who grows rice on his family's 15 hectares (37 acres) in Sheikhupura district, said switching to the new planting method had cut the amount of irrigation needed in his rice fields by around 40 percent, a crucial change as groundwater levels drop.""This is really no small benefit,"" he said, smiling. ""This is helping us adapt to water shortages.""Muhammad learned the new technique under a four-year agricultural innovation programme, launched in 2013 by partners including the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the International Rice Research Institute.The $30 million project aims to help Pakistan's farmers boost their profits while coping with climate change risks to the sustainability of water and agriculture, said John Groarke, head of USAID in Pakistan.Besides its work on rice, the programme has introduced heat-tolerant maize and higher-yielding wheat varieties, he added.Muhammad Ibrahim Mughal, chairman of Agri Forum Pakistan, a farmers' rights organisation, said traditional rice cultivation was time-consuming and laborious, as farmers spend long hours bent over in fields.It has also become less viable as river flows decrease and groundwater declines, he added.As a result, farmers are now increasingly willing to experiment with the new growing technique, said Sardar Karim, another farmer from Punjab province.Direct sowing is producing a 25 percent boost in harvests under ideal conditions on the test plots, said Iftikhar Ahmed, chairman of the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council.",10/8/15,water short pakistani farmers test less thirsty way to grow ri,,,321,"KHUSHAB: National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) has announced an advance tariff for a local company engaged in the generation of electricity through a solar plant.NEPRA in its decision has fixed the per unit rate of the electricity produced here at Rs15.77.The company that produces 12 MW of electricity through a solar plant had applied for the advance tariff.

The improvement largely owes to declining oil price that has substantially reduced the oil import payments healthy workers remittances and the realization of Coalition Support Fund.At the back of official disbursements and Eurobond inflows surplus in capital and financial account has supported the overall balance of payments position thus ensuring an upward trajectory in foreign exchange reserves in Jul Oct FY16.

But the health ministry later said the warnings must be adopted on April 1.The panel of lawmakers last month called for reducing the size of warnings to 50 percent to protect the interests of the industry and tobacco farmers.ITC said the health ministry's push to go ahead with its rule was ""contrary to its earlier decision to await the (parliamentary) committee's findings"".

however, more can be done to realize its potential as a regional hub and to continue to boost opportunities, especially for women and the poor, according to a new World Bank report.The Stitches to Riches Apparel Employment Trade and Economic Development, launched in Pakistan today, is aimed at demystifying the global and South Asian apparel markets, estimating the potential gains in exports and jobs and identifying policies that can unleash country' s export and job potential compared with those of their closest competitors in the Southeast Asia region ' Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia.The report finds that it is important for South Asian economies to remove existing impediments and facilitate growth in apparel to capture more production and create more employment as wages rise in China.The successful manufacturers will be those who can supply a wide range of quality products to buyers rapidly and reliably,'not just those who offer low costs.China currently dominates global apparel trade but that may change in coming years due to the rising prices in China.Investors are compelled to seek out apparel firms in other countries. The potential decrease in Chinese exports presents a huge opportunity for South Asian countries.A 10 percent increase in Chinese apparel prices would increase apparel employment in Pakistan for males by 8.93 percent,'by far the biggest winner,'followed by Bangladesh 4.22 percent and India 3.32 percent.Women are also expected to benefit the most as their share in the total apparel employment is much higher than their share in other industries. This is true for Pakistan as well.The report finds that 1 percent increase in expected wages in Pakistan would raise the probability of women entering the labor force by 16.3 percent. Job creation is among the government's top priorities.Apparel manufacturing presents the poor with job opportunities in Pakistan, especially for females, says Illango Patchamuthu, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.These employed women would in return spend more on the health and education of their children which will contribute towards the larger development goals of the country.Pakistan has a fast'growing apparel sector that accounts for 19 percent of its exports and firms are competitive with global exporters in terms of prices.Yet despite low prices in most apparel product categories, Pakistan lags competitors in reliability and policy continuation. It also remains highly concentrated in cotton products.South Asia has taken many steps in recent years to support the textile and apparel sector but it now needs to step up its game by tackling inefficiencies that are undercutting its competitiveness, says Gladys C Lopez'Acevedo, one of the authors of the report and a Lead Economist for the World Bank.Pakistan should use this opportunity and implement policies to become a regional leader in creating good jobs, bringing more women into the work force and diversifying its products and end markets to increase skills and value.The report suggests that Pakistan could benefit from the following policies.

Japanese equity prices surged and inflation also strengthened during this period.Despite Southeast Asian currencies rising against the yen, they mirrored some of these effects, study authors GiovanniGanelli, and Nour Tawk said.

Capital inflows surged in many countries.""They argue that while most existing research uses interest rate changes as proxies for quantitative easing, this transmission channel is broken in Japan because rates have been at the zero bound for an extended period.Instead, they use stock market surges and increases in the monetary base as proxies for QQE.The researchers said that Japan's QQE caused a significant increase in equity prices in emerging Asia, with increases in the 2 to 5 percent range for China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia.And while nearly all countries surveyed experienced an appreciation of their currencies versus the yen as a result of QQE, it had a ""generally positive"" impact on growth in emerging Asian countries, with statistically significant increases in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.",5/21/16,IMF researchers say Japan monetary easing has benefits for Asian economi,,,659,ABU DHABI: Thousands of layoffs at state-linked companies in Abu Dhabi are a fresh sign the Gulf's wealthy oil states are hunkering down for a long period of austerity as low crude prices pressure their economies.CUTS,5/22/16,Abu Dhabi lays off staff Gulf austerity tig,,,660,"LONDON: British Prime Minister David Cameron warned voters on Sunday that they would face higher grocery bills if the country decides to leave the European Union at a June 23 referendum, citing a potential drop in the value of sterling.",5/22/16,UK PM Cameron warns Brexit drive up food pri,,,661,LONDON: Trains will run all night at the weekend from August 19 on two lines of the London Underground metro network in what new Mayor Sadiq Khan said on Monday would be a boost to the British capital's night-time economy.,5/23/16,After long dispute London metro run night weekend,,,662,"DUBAI: Beauty world Middle East, the largest international trade fair for beauty products, hair, fragrances and well-being in the Middle East, has closed its doors in Dubai at the Dubai International Convention and Exhibition Centre, after three very lively days of business featuring more than 1,500 exhibitors from 60 countries.",5/23/16,Pakistani exhibitors showcase productsBeauty world fair,,,663,ISLAMABAD: The textile exports from the country witnessed negative growth of 7.72 percent during the first ten months of the current fiscal year compared to the corresponding period of last year.,5/23/16,Pakistan Textile exports decline 77,,,664,"LONDON: Pakistan plans to sell a 40 percent stake in its stock exchange in coming months, and Turkey's Borsa Istanbul has expressed some initial intent, the head of the bourse said on Monday.",5/23/16,Pakistan sell 40 percent stock exchange end 2016early 2017,,,665,"SINGAPORE: Oil prices slipped in early Asian trade on Monday on a strong dollar as the odds grow of a June or July rate hike, and signs that global oil supply is' holding up even as unplanned outages rise to at least a five-year high.was quoted on Sunday as saying.Tehran is trying to raise its crude exports to pre-sanctions levels.

It is clearly evident that, from a shopkeeper to a businessman, Q Mobile'serves all Socio - Economic Classes.Once upon a time, these phones were used to send a message or receive a call but now, with all telecom operators providing affordable data services, the use of smartphones takes a completely new level of information.We now have access to mobile payment solutions, where we can send or receive money from distant areas within a fraction of seconds. We can shop online and pay via our mobile phones, connect with our loved ones living abroad via video calling, social networking and staying ever connected with all the news from around the world.Very soon, our farmers will check the daily commodity rate or inquire about delivery to the market.

Foreign dignitaries, including the presidents of Taiwan, Chile, and other Central American nations, will be present at the ceremony.A Chinese-owned Neopanamax-class cargo ship will be the first vessel to officially test the new infrastructure, entering from the Atlantic and exiting into the Pacific a few hours later.The Neopanamax vessels are much bigger than the Panamax-class ships that previously were the largest able to pass through the 80-kilometer (50-mile) long canal. Each is able to haul three times as much cargo as the smaller predecessors.The expansion work began in 2007 and was meant to have been completed in 2014, but it ran well past deadline, and over budget.The expansion is estimated to have cost $5.5 billion. But there are outstanding disputes between the Spanish- and Italian-led consortium that carried out the work and the Panamanian government that could hike that figure by hundreds of millions more.  For Panama, the unveiling of the broader canal is a moment of pride and of opportunity.Now, ships as long as the Eiffel Tower is tall, and as broad as Olympic-sized swimming pools, will be able to use the canal.Annual cargo volumes should double over the next decade, leading Panama to hope to triple the $1 billion in shipping fees it receives each year.Also, with the country these days linked to the ""Panama Papers"" scandal of offshore businesses owned by the world's wealthy and influential, the expanded canal is seen as a chance to burnish the country's tarnished image.This will show the ""real face of Panama,"" the head of the Panama Canal Authority, Jorge Quijano told AFP in an interview this week.World trade should also benefit from what will essentially be an inter-oceanic highway for goods between the United States and Asia.

A fiscal consolidation drive to improve federal finances has constrained the federal government from carrying out important reforms related to the public sector enterprises, including a reduction in contingent liabilities from pensions and other related costs. Among enterprises that need immediate financial support for initiating important reforms are power distribution companies and Pakistan Railways.The full program will help the government draw up and roll out a comprehensive reform plan to improve the financial transparency of public sector enterprises and to strengthen their corporate governance. It will include support to establish a retirement cost fund to manage huge unfunded pensions and other retirement liabilities of workers. Unfunded pension risk presents a serious threat to the financial health of the enterprises.Measures to strengthen auditing, accounting and other elements of operations at Pakistan Railways will also be supported by the program, along with actions to improve the performance of federal financial sector entities to boost financial inclusion in the country.The program is part of a broader, coordinated donors package for public sector enterprise reforms, with other assistance being provided by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

surprisingly strong rate in June after an unnerving stall in May, in a clear demonstration of economic resilience, the Labor Department reported Friday.The much better-than-expected numbers gave a boost to markets in the US and Europe, which have been battered down by worries that Britain's vote to withdraw from the European Union will drag down economic growth.Private businesses and government authorities across the United States generated 287,000 new positions last month, 112,000 more than analysts had expected.The strongest hiring was in the health care, hospitality, information and retail sales sectors, while government hiring also picked up.That largely compensated for the poor numbers from May that had shocked policymakers and markets, sending the dollar lower and contributing to the Federal Reserve's decision last month to put off an interest rate hike.The May job creation numbers in fact were revised downward in Friday's data from the original 38,000 reported to just 11,000.June's hiring levels boosted the monthly average of the last three months to a solid 147,000, which economists say is adequate to keep bringing down unemployment overall.""This is a good trend but nothing spectacular. It suggests that hiring has taken a step down since late last year but that job growth is still strong enough to absorb slack in the labor market,"" said analysts at Nomura Global Economics in a client note.""Most important, today's report quells any concerns of a broader economic slowdown in the US.""Markets reacted positively, with the S&P 500 surging 1.5 percent to a fraction shy of an all-time record.In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX index gained 2.2 percent Paris's CAC 40 added 1.8 percent, while in London the FTSE 100 barometer rose 0.9 percent.As analysts said the data increases the chances that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at least once before the end of the year, early in the session the dollar jumped and US bond yields, which had plunged in recent weeks, spiked higher.The jobs numbers were not unequivocally good. Wage growth, another indicator of economic strength, slowed slightly, bringing the annual pace for the last three months to 2.5 percent, compared with the 12-month rate of 2.6 percent.And the unemployment rate, which is based on a separate database from the job creation numbers, rose by 0.2 percentage points to 4.9 percent, though still near the lowest level in more than eight years.That rise was mainly due to a large jump in the number of people reported rejoining the workforce, diluting the impact of the hiring surge on the jobless rate.In May the unemployment rate had fallen from 5.0 percent to 4.7 percent after the volatile data showed a huge number of people had dropped out of the labor force.'",7/9/16,US economy looks strong with 287000 jobs added in Ju,,,786,"SHANGHAI: The world's top 20 economies will work to boost sluggish global trade despite growing protectionism, overcapacity concerns, and uncertainty over Brexit, G20 trade ministers said Sunday at a meeting in Shanghai.""The global recovery continues, but it remains uneven and falls short of our ambition for strong, sustainable and balanced growth. Downside risks and vulnerabilities persist,"" the trade ministers said in a joint statement, adding that trade should remain ""an important engine"" to spur global growth.The G20 nations, which account for 85 percent of global trade, admitted that protectionism has been rising since the financial crisis, and said that new trade restrictions in the group had reached the highest monthly average registered since the WTO began monitoring in 2009.""We note with concern that despite the G20's repeated pledge, the stock of restrictive measure affecting trade in goods and services has continued to rise,"" they said in the statement.Ahead of the meeting, WTO chief economist Robert Koopman warned that restrictive measures could affect industries including air freight cargo, sea based cargo, automobile sales and production, electronics trade, and agricultural raw materials.The world's leading economies at the weekend pledged to oppose trade protectionism and reiterated a promise not to add new protective measures until 2018.Global trade is expected to grow at a tepid 2.8 percent in 2016, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) said in April.And this year is expected to be the fifth in a row where trade grew at less than three percent -- its weakest sustained level in 30 years, WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo said on Friday ahead of the talks.To combat the global slowdown, the ministers said they agreed to improve global trade governance and to work towards easing and liberalising trade.

European companies and consumers.""We cannot sit on our hands seeing our producers and consumers being hit by unfair trading practices,"" the EU's top trade official Cecilia Malmstroem said in a statement.The EU launched similar successful actions against China in 2012 and 2014 over rare earths and raw materials like bauxite, zinc and coke.The new challenge targets export restrictions on graphite, cobalt, copper, lead, chromium, magnesia, talcum, tantalum, tin, antimony and indium.""The past two WTO rulings on Chinese export restrictions have been crystal clear -- these measures are against international trade rules,"" Malmstroem said.""As we do not see China advancing to remove them all, we must take legal action,"" she added.In filing a similar action last week before the WTO, the US government said that when China joined the WTO in 2001, it agreed to eliminate such export duties but had failed to follow through on the commitment.The US action covered nine of the 11 materials mentioned in the EU action, excluding chromium and indium.These raw materials are essential for a broad range of industry, from aerospace and car manufacturing to electronics and chemicals.In Washington, the US trade representative's office said China's export duties ranged from five to 20 percent, raising prices for overseas buyers while Chinese companies paid much less and had more secure supplies.In addition, the export duties put pressure on non-Chinese manufacturers to shift production, technologies and jobs to China, it said.As with the US challenge, the EU action launches formal consultations with China as a first step to settle the dispute.If the two sides fail to reach a settlement in 60 days, the EU may decide to ask the WTO to establish a panel to determine whether China's measures are compatible with the Geneva-based body's rules.The European Commission, the executive arm of the 28-nation EU, is due Wednesday to review trade links with China

Chinese firms are eyeing new Pakistan power projects, roads and some engineering contracts but investing in a large private company that deals directly with consumers would be a first, a senior Karachi-based financial adviser said.NO GUARANTEEbillion, is seeking final bids for its stake by the end of August.Sources cautioned that although talks between the parties are advanced, there is no certainty of a deal being clinched.The Pakistani government owns about 24 percent, but a spokesman for the water and power ministry said it was not intalks to sell.CPEC envisages the construction of roads, pipelines and power plants across Pakistan that run south to Gwadar port and should mean more business for distribution companies like K-Electric that sell the electricity to users.China and Pakistan call each other ""all-weather friends"" and' their ties have been underpinned by long-standing wariness of their common neighbour, India, and a desire to hedge against U.S.influence in the region.Islamabad wants Chinese funding to reinvigorate an economy hurt by militant violence and weak productivity, to provide new jobs and to ease chronic power shortages.For China, markets like Pakistan and Malaysia are opening up new frontiers, just as it faces hurdles in countries including Australia.""CHINESE ARE COMING""Sohail, CEO at Karachi-based brokerage Topline Securities.""Before it was always U.S. and Europe. The Chinese are coming,"" Sohail added. Still, foreign investment in Pakistan remains relatively muted as it struggles to shake off a reputation for violence, corruption and instability, and despite the $250 billion economy growing at its fastest pace in eight years.Inbound M&A into Pakistan has risen more than six times in the past five years, totalling $516 million so far this year,according to Thomson Reuters data. K-Electric, Pakistan's biggest electricity company, supplies power to over 2.2 million customers in and around Karachi, the country's biggest and wealthiest city.The utility has undergone a turnaround since Abraaj bought it; K-Electric has cut down on electricity theft and reducedoutages.""Abraaj has done a good job but for a newcomer to get involved in a city like Karachi is not easy,"" said theKarachi-based adviser, referring to a city where power theft, violence and political turmoil have scared investors away.""The Chinese are looking at a lot of things but they are also very cautious. ""Sources said some Pakistani firms were also bidding, but it was not clear how keen they were, and they would likely find it tough to match the Chinese in an auction which could go as high as $2 billion.China Southern Power Grid declined comment, while Shanghai Electric Power confirmed it was bidding but gave no details.

entire district with a mixture of residential and office blocks, hotels and a mall, along the city's Sheikh Zayed artery.The project is being developed by state-owned Dubai Holding -- the maker of the luxurious, sail-shaped Burj al-Arab hotel.Emaar South is another new development announced on the eve of Cityscape by Emaar Properties, which built Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest tower, among other Dubai landmarks.It is to be erected in Dubai South, a vast desert that hosts Dubai's second airport Al-Maktoum which is touted to become the world's largest and replace Dubai International as the base for Emirates Airline.Dubai became a magnet for property investments when it opened the sector to foreigners in 2002, standing out in a region that mostly confines freehold ownership to citizens.The value of property surged at breakneck speed until the global financial crisis hit the debt-laden emirate in 2009, sending prices into free-fall.A recovery led by tourism, trade and transportation pushed prices up again between 2012 and 2014 and stirred fears of yet another bubble, before they headed south again at a slow pace.Prices had dropped by about 15 percent since peaking in mid-2014,

only 18 when he handed a five-year ban from cricket in 2011 for his involvement in spot fixing.He also served three months of a six month prison term.His ban, imposed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), has now ended and McCullum said today he should be allowed to resume his career.'He was a very young man at the time and he's gone through a sound rehabilitation program,' McCullum said.'If he gets out on the field against us, then you play against the man you're playing against, not a man who may have made some mistakes as a youngster,' added the explosive batsman.New Zealand Cricket chief executive David White also supported Amir's inclusion in the Pakistan squad but stressed that was a personal view and not that of his organisation.'He was a very, very young man, a boy really (when he was suspended),' White said.'He showed remorse at the time, admitted to it. He's gone through all the rehabilitation and education as prescribed by the ICC.'I'm personally comfortable with him coming to New Zealand and playing,' added White.New Zealand's immigration department issued a statement before Christmas saying it had not yet received a visa application for Amir and would consider one when it is received.A decision is likely next week.",1/3/16,McCullum says Amir should get benefit of doub,,,1025,"CAPE TOWN: Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow tore apart the South African bowling attack as they enjoyed a run feast at Newlands on a record-breaking second day of the second Test which led to England declaring their first innings on 629 for six.South Africa were 24 for one wicket in reply at tea with a 605-run deficit.Stokes amassed 258 runs and Bairstow an unbeaten 150 as they bludgeoned a limp-looking home attack from the opening ball on Sunday, setting a new sixth-wicket Test record of 399 runs.Stokes notched up the quickest 250 (off 196 balls) in Test history after scoring the second fastest double century (163 balls) in a knock that lasted 198 deliveries, which included 30 fours and a England record 11 sixes.Bairstow notched an emotional first test century, with England declaring once he got to 150 off 191 balls with 18 fours and two sixes.The pair took the overnight score from 317 for five in a remarkable one and half sessions of devastating batting before putting the dispirited-looking home side into bat.Stokes' double century took 10 balls more than New Zealand's Nathan Astle, who holds the record for the fastest double century in 153 balls. England's previous fastest was by Ian Botham who took 220 balls.In reaching 250 off 196 balls, Stokes beat Virender Sehwag's record and also set the highest score by a batsman at number six, beating a 39-year-old mark held by Australian Doug Walters.England, already 1-0 up in the four-Test series after winning the first test in Durban by 241 runs, went from 300 to 400 in 15 overs and 400 to 500 runs in just 11 overs playing as if it was a Twenty20 match.They set the tone from the start of the second day with 45 runs in the first four overs as Stokes advanced from 74 not out overnight to his century.Bairstow started the day on 39.Stokes eventually went out in something of an anti-climax as he skied a shot to AB de Villiers, who dropped a simple-looking catch only to sweep up the ball and hit the stumps to run out the batsman as he ambled back to the crease.South Africa's horror day did not end after the declaration with Stiaan van Zyl run out for four in the third over of their first innings, setting off for a quick run but being sent back by opening partner Dean Elgar.Elgar (8) and captain Hashim Amla (10) were not out at tea with Elgar surviving a leg before wicket decision after a review showed he got the slightest of edges to the ball.

He fell 15 runs shy off his fifth test century when Lyon got a little bit of extra bounce to a delivery which caught the opener's glove and was snaffled up by Steve Smith at slip.

Amla was twice dropped -- by Joe Root on 76 and Nick Compton on 120 -- and De Villiers survived an lbw appeal after asking for a review, which showed he got a slight nick to a Ben Stokes delivery.De Villiers became the third South African batsman to pass 8,000 runs while Amla, who last made a significant contribution with 208 runs against the West Indies in December 2014, moved past 7,000 runs.The 31-year-old De Villiers joined Jacques Kallis (13,206) and Graeme Smith (9,253) on the list of South Africans with more than 8,000 Test runs.England, 1-0 up in the series, bowled good lines and with spells of aggression on a pitch that offered little assistance and in hot temperatures of over 30 degrees celsius.The third day, however, provided none of the fireworks of Sunday when Stokes and Jonny Bairstow smashed the ball to all corners of the picturesque ground.

One of the main mantras in cricket is that when things are going good you maximize,"" Brathwaite said.""Then reaching halfway off and hearing the applause -- I even saw some people standing -- I just took a step back and said 'you know what, just enjoy the feeling'. I raised my bat and looked around and it was a very, very good feeling.""Denesh Ramdin will resume on 30 not out for West Indies alongside Kemar Roach, who has yet to score, on day three.Only three balls were bowled in the first two hours of scheduled play and another 21 before lunch after the action resumed briefly at noon.Nearly three hours of play were lost to rain on day one of the match, a dead rubber after Australia racked up convincing victories in the first two Tests.

He smacked an unbeaten 43 before picking up the vital wicket of Hamilton Masakadza, one of his three scalps, as the wind was taken out of the visitors' 168-run chase in the ninth over.Soumya Sarkar also made 43, but missed out on a bigger score after he threw his wicket away in the 10th over. Yet, Bangladesh kept hitting the boundaries - they managed 11 fours and eight sixes to equal their own record of most sixes in a T20 innings. Zimbabwe's reply was nearly a mirror image of Bangladesh's first half, until Sabbir came along to seal a victory that gave Bangladesh a 2-0 lead in the four-match series.Bangladesh started well, but the real push came when Tamim Iqbal hammered Neville Madziva for a four and six in the fifth over. But just as he started to rev up his engine, he also found a top edge that was easily taken by Brian Vitori at fine leg in the sixth over.Sarkar also looked authoritative by striking three fours and a six before Tamim fell and he then built the base further with Sabbir. But Sarkar threw it away in the 10th over as Malcolm Waller took an easy catch at deep midwicket to end his promising innings of 43.Zimbabwe were further boosted by the wicket of Mahmudullah, who fell to a superb catch by wicketkeeper Richmond Mutumbami. Then Mushfiqur Rahim batted through the second half of the innings to give Bangladesh a solid total to defend adding 52 for the fourth wicket with Sabbir.Sabbir made the most of a reprieve on 7 by Mutumbami as he lined up the straight boundaries well, even as Mushfiqur used the bowler's pace well in his 20-ball 24 before hobbling off the field. Shakib then finished off the innings with a cameo as Bangladesh took 50 off the last five overs.Masakadza came out all guns blazing, hitting two fours and two sixes in 2.2 overs, while Vusi Sibanda also soon got into the act. Zimbabwe were reprieved twice in the fourth over bowled by Mashrafe Mortaza. First, the substitute Imrul Kayes dropped Masakadza at cover, before Shuvagata couldn't reach a chance at midwicket.But Mashrafe soon had a wicket to show as Sibanda was bowled off the inside edge for 21 off 17. It was then that Sabbir was thrown the ball, and he delivered by having Masakadza caught at long-on for a 28-ball 30 that had three fours and two sixes. Sean Williams fell soon after to give Shuvagata his first T20I wicket and leave Zimbabwe needing a further 103 runs from the last ten overs. Sabbir then had the wicket of Mutumbami, who holed out to Sarkar at deep midwicket.Malcolm Waller briefly kept Zimbabwe in it by striking a four each in the 13th, 14th and 15th over, but an already escalating rate was compounded by Bangladesh's spinners. Waller was eventually dismissed for a 21-ball 29 by Al-Amin Hossain in the 16th over.Mustafizur Rahman then came to the party to dismiss Madziva and Peter Moor in the 17th over to puncture Zimbabwe. The eighth wicket was fittingly taken by Sabbir, who became the second Bangladesh cricketer to score at least 40 and take two wickets in T20.With a series win out of the equation, Zimbabwe have two more matches to potentially get their combinations right leading to the World T20.

I didn't play the game the way I wanted to but he didn't let me.""After Johanna Konta earlier earned her place in the quarter-finals, Murray's victory means Britain will have a presence in the last eight of both draws of a grand slam for the first time since the 1977 Australian Open.Murray has his eye firmly fixed on becoming Britain's first men's champion in Australia since Fred Perry in 1934 but he must get past Ferrer to do it.

in the last four of a grand slam for the first time since 1977.The 47th-ranked Konta will seek to continue her fairytale run on Thursday when she meets German seventh seed Angelique Kerber for a place in the title-decider.Konta's rise has been little short of extraordinary, with her last trip to Melbourne Park cut short with a humbling exit at qualifying when ranked 147th in the world.Twelve months on, the Sydney-born 24-year-old has emulated Eugenie Bouchard's breathtaking run at the 2014 tournament by reaching the last four on her main draw debut at Melbourne Park.The last British woman to make a grand slam semi-final was Jo Durie at the 1983 U.S.Open, while the last finalist was the 1977 Wimbledon champion Virginia Wade.Konta will bid to become the first British woman to reach the Australian Open final since Wade's run to the 1972 title.Although Konta has reached lofty heights for British tennis, the quarter-final against Zhang failed to soar quite so high.Both players battled nerves and the Chinese qualifier came into the match fatigued after playing seven straight matches.Konta steadied first and rushed to a 5-2 lead before an attack of nerves nearly brought her

Yes!"" as he pumped his fist at the ground.Murray served out the set to even up the contest again and grabbed two breaks early in the decider as the wincing Raonic's level dropped, the Canadian's racket feeling the brunt of his frustration after the first.Murray finished off his ailing opponent with a sublime crosscourt backhand volley to bring up a match point, which he converted with a handsome forehand winner.The 28-year-old pointed both index fingers at the roof of Rod Laver Arena before slumping into his courtside chair with a look of relief on his face.The relief will not be long-lived, however, as he will be back on the same court on Sunday attempting to dethrone five-times champion Djokovic.Murray's older brother Jamie will be bidding for silverware on Saturday when he teams up with Bruno Soares to take on Daniel Nestor and Radek Stepanek in the men's doubles final.It is the first time two brothers have reached separate finals at the same grand slam.

(Reuters) -Saturday's match showcased his blossoming capabilities, with New Zealand slumping to 193 for six in the 37th over and in danger of being bowled out before their full allocation.Santner, who was joined by the right-handed Milne 12 runs later, however kept the strike ticking over to put the bowlers off their rhythm, turned singles into twos with hard running and hit the bad ball to the boundary.Opening bowler Josh Hazlewood, however, ended the partnership, and stopped New Zealand from edging closer to a more competitive 300, to finish with 3-61 from 10 overs.'",2/6/16,Marsh guides Australia to series levelling win in NZ,,,1168,"WELLINGTON: New Zealand tallied 281 for 9 in Wellington despite a much improved Australian bowling and fielding effort in a match the visitors must win to keep the Chappell-Hadlee series alive.Kane Williamson made a smooth 60 but it was a late-innings partnership of 61 from 44 balls between Mitchell Santner and Adam Milne that added heft to the innings after the Australians had claimed regular wickets throughout the afternoon.Legspinner Adam Zampa bowled well in his first international match to claim the wickets of Williamson and Grant Elliott, while John Hastings, Josh Hazlewood, Scott Boland and Mitchell Marsh also put in decent shifts with the ball.Nevertheless, Australia must perform far more staunchly with the bat than they managed in the series opener at Eden Park if they wish to force a decider at Seddon Park in Hamilton in two days' time. Usman Khawaja, among others, will be eager to make a difference.Australia made three changes to the team that was given a hiding in Auckland, dropping Shaun Marsh for Khawaja, while Boland came in for Kane Richardson due to back soreness, and the debutant Zampa was called up in place of the injured James Faulkner. Zampa had his ODI cap presented to him by Allan Border.New Zealand, by contrast, were unchanged, in a match where they can complete a series victory over Australia for the first time since 2007. Their captain Brendon McCullum led a typically hyperactive start to proceedings, clattering 28 from 12 balls including a six off each of the Australia pacemen.Boland's very first ball was sent flying back over his head and into the sight screen, but he responded well by pulling back his length and being rewarded when McCullum charged again and was bowled. That wicket scotched much of the early momentum, even if Martin Guptill and Williamson moved along smoothly enough for the next 11 overs.It was Mitchell Marsh who broke the stand, prompting a miscue from Guptill when he tried to force the pace a little more. The chance swirled out towards deep cover, where Khawaja showed excellent judgment to claim a catch more difficult than it appeared. Marsh had another victim when Henry Nicholls, called up to the Test team this week, wafted at a wide delivery. New Zealand had stalled.Williamson and Elliott formed another useful stand without ever looking in total command. This was in part due to the thoughtful work of Zampa, who varied his pace artfully to keep the batsmen guessing. His reward would come in consecutive overs, as first Williamson then Elliott pushed catches to cover as they tried to manufacture boundaries.That put New Zealand five down, and regular wickets from there prevented the hosts from pulling together a total of the dimensions they managed at Eden Park. Santner and Milne pulled back some of the ground in the closing overs, but the tourists could be happier with their effort.'",2/6/16,New Zealand set 282 for Australia in second ODI,,,1169,"WELLINGTON: New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum won the toss and chose to bat first against Australia in the second Chappell-Hadlee ODI at Westpac Stadium in Wellington.Australia made three changes to the team that was given a hiding at Eden Park, dropping Shaun Marsh for Usman Khawaja, while Scott Boland came in for Kane Richardson due to some back soreness, and the debutant Adam Zampa came into the side in place of the injured James Faulkner.

He dismissed Babar Azam for a duck in his first over, Umar Amin for four in his second and then got the big wicket of Misbah-ul-Haq for 12 as Islamabad lost half their side for 66 runs. Shane Watson, who made 28, was their top-scorer, but he was dismissed by Wahab in the ninth over.Sam Billings and Andre Russell resisted, but both of them fell off successive balls and Wahab finished with 3 for 32. Asghar had a hand in those wickets too - he clung on to two sharp chances on the cover boundary and later played them down by saying he had large hands like most Pathans and so it would be hard to drop catches. So United fell to 121 for 9 and their second defeat in as many matches.In the first innings, Peshawar managed to reach 145 with Tamim Iqbal making a run-a-ball half-century. It ended up a crucial contribution considering Peshawar, having chosen to bat, had stumbled to 88 for 4 in the 15th over and needed a set batsman in the middle for Shahid Afridi and Darren Sammy to go hard at the other end.

Shikhar Dhawan was bruiser-in-prime, unleashing an early shellacking that brought him 51, and set the team on course to a big total. They reached 196 for 6, thanks to helpful hands from the top five, which today included a pinch-hitting Hardik Pandva. That total was 69 too many for Sri Lanka.On a pitch with little pace and minimal seam movement, the pacers that had delivered Sri Lanka's Pune win, were expensive. Even Sri Lanka's first T20 international hat-trick - to Thisara Perera - barely made a difference, coming as it did in the penultimate over. Dinesh Chandimal will perhaps rue having chosen to bowl first.R Ashwin had troubled Sri Lanka's batsmen even on the Pune green top, and MS Dhoni savvily had him open the bowling here. Ashwin removed a returning Tillakaratne Dilshan second ball, and the chase never really recovered from that. Soon they were 3 for 16, Ashish Nehra claiming two early scalps. Chandimal and Chamara Kapugedara then embarked on a recovery that was far too slow to give the visitors any real chance of victory, and wickets tumbled late in the middle overs, as the required rate crept up through the teens. Ashwin finished with 3 for 14 from his four overs.Dhawan got to 50 off his 22nd delivery, but departed soon after, nicking a throat-high Dushmantha Chameera ball to the keeper. That wicket bought Sri Lanka brief respite. They bowled five overs for 30, before the runs began to flow again.Chameera claimed Rohit's scalp in the 14th over, with an athletic return catch, and Senanayake removed Rahane soon after, but India's final push began when Pandya arrived at the crease a few places higher than he would normally bat. After two sighters he began his assault.Raina added his own finishing blows to the closing surge, taking particular liking to Chameera, whose figures he ruined. Having sent down his first two overs for 10 runs, Chameera saw his third disappear for 18. His last also went for 10. In between Perera took a low-key hat-trick, having Pandya, Raina and Yuvraj Singh hole out to low full tosses. His figures were dramatically improved as a result. He finished with 3 for 33 from three overs.Dilshan was stumped over-reaching off the first ball he faced. Seekkuge Prasanna was sent up the order to provide some early impetus, but lacked the technique to deal with the new ball, and chewed up four balls for one run. Danushka Gunathilaka amplified Sri Lanka's problems at the top of the order with another poor score.Kapugedara and Chandimal's 49-ball fourth-wicket partnership yielded only 52 runs. By the time they had departed, off successive Jadeja deliveries in the 12th over, the required rate had climbed to more than 14.5, and the chase was kaput.

Both those events will be held in England.Broad enjoyed an excellent Test on this ground less than a month ago, where he claimed 6 for 17 in the second innings to help England secure the series.He may find conditions less helpful this time, though.

Television replays showed the delivery was clearly legal.The tourists had earlier dismissed New Zealand for 183, Josh Hazlewood and Peter Siddle reducing them to 51-5 in the 12th over and Nathan Lyon polishing off the tail after lunch.Hazlewood finished with 4-42, Siddle took 3-37, while off-spinner Lyon grabbed 3-32 and the tea break was taken 10 minutes early when Trent Boult was caught at long on for 24.Craig top-scored with 41 not out but the pitch appeared to have lost much of its bite by the end of New Zealand's innings, which lasted 48 overs.Tim Southee, however, managed to get rid of both Joe Burns (0) and David Warner (5) to leave the visitors 5-2 in the third over and with the sell-out crowd in full voice.Southee and Boult kept up the pressure on Smith and Khawaja but when they scored 37 runs, from nine fours and a single, in 16 deliveries, the shackles were broken and crowd silenced.Smith was eventually dismissed about 20 minutes before stumps when he hit the ball back to Craig to end the 126-run partnership.The crowd began the day celebrating McCullum's milestone as he became just the third New Zealander to earn 100 Test caps and the first man in world cricket to achieve them in succession from debut.Australia, however, seized control of the match shortly after Smith won the toss and simply bowled straight and waited for the ball to do just enough to catch the outside edge.New Zealand's first seven wickets all fell to catches behind the stumps, but the last three, all Lyon's victims, were caught in front from mis-timed attacking shots.

In a rain-interrupted innings, South Africa, anchored by Dane van Niekerk 's second successive fifty, held their nerve and paced their chase well to ensure Sunday's fixture will be a decider.After England defended 147 in Paarl a day ago, they would have thought they had enough when they crept over that total at Newlands. Sarah Taylor formed the spine of the innings, as she did in the first match, but she also had greater support. She shared in a 61-run second-wicket stand with Charlotte Edwards and a 63-run fourth-wicket partnership with Heather Knight but South Africa, helped by wayward bowling and clumsy fielding from England, were not overawed.Van Niekerk, who was dropped on 6 and 22, set the tone when she dispatched a loosener from Anya Shrubsole and then punished Danielle Hazell, who erred in length. She was almost run out, too, when Trisha Chetty sent her back even though she had advanced more than halfway down the wicket from the non-striker's end. The throw from Hazell came in at the striker's end instead but quick work from Taylor ensured Chetty was out.If van Niekerk was shaken by it, she did not show any signs and struck the first six of the innings with a slog sweep. She hit the ball with power and fine placement and beat short third man with a delicate lap to enter the 40s. Her fifty came via a pull off the 34th ball she faced. That shot also took South Africa halfway to the target.They were well placed on 80 for 1 after 10 overs and England could not pull them back. Jenny Gunn was punished for width but, just as South Africa seemed to get away, Rebecca Grundy struck. She beat van Niekerk, who had come down the track, and Taylor whipped the bails off.The first rains fell at the end of that over but South Africa, at 108 for 2, were well ahead on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern and Marizanne Kapp had already showed her intent to finish things off fast with two furious pulls.The delay was short and Mignon du Preez and Kapp kept South Africa above the required rate, so that when the second interruption happened, four over and two balls later, South Africa were still ahead despite Kapp's dismissal.

Taylor anchored a relatively straightforward chase - the first time England have batted second in the series - after captain Edwards opted to bowl first under cloudy skies and England restricted their opposition to 131 for 4.England took advantage of the swing on offer and reduced South Africa to 6 for 3 in the second over before Mignon du Preez and Lizelle Lee built the recovery. They shared an 89-run stand for the fourth wicket to engineer a strong comeback - Lee's unbeaten 69 off 61 balls was a career-best - but South Africa's score on a good pitch and a fast outfield, never looked enough.South Africa's problems started early when Tash Farrant, the left-armer making her first appearance in the series, had Trish Chetty stumped down the leg side off a wide. In the next over, Anya Shrubsole found movement and bowled Dane van Niekerk, who was playing in her 50th T20I, and Marizanne Kapp with successive inswinging deliveries. She was not far away from a hat-trick with another full and straight delivery to Lee but a thin inside edge saved the batsman.Lee kept her composure and rebuilt steadily with her captain, du Preez. They complemented each other well with Lee the aggressor and du Preez the accumulator. The ninth over was the most profitable with Lee taking 15 runs off Jenny Gunn before offering a chance. Lee was on 30 and hit the last ball of the over to long off but Heather Knight could not hold on.South Africa still had work to do at 49 for 3 at the halfway stage. Du Preez shifted gears and helped by some ordinary fielding from England, started to speed up the scoring rate. South Africa managed 26 runs in three overs before Farrant was brought back to quieten things down.With not even 100 on the board and only four overs left, South Africa's urgency grew. Du Preez was run out by a direct hit after a trying to steal a second off a Knight fumble and it was up to Lee to finish strongly. She reached 50 off 51 balls immediately after du Preez was dismissed and played a part in South Africa scoring 35 runs off the last three overs. They still ended with the lowest first-innings score of the series and would have known it would be tough to defend.England were into their task early when Amy Jones climbed into overpitched deliveries from Shabnim Ismail. She scored 14 runs off the first over before Ismail had her caught behind. But, as was the case in Cape Town when South Africa made the early breakthrough, it brought England's best pair together but this time it was not for too long. While Taylor scored freely, Edwards could not get away and gifted deep square leg a catch to give South Africa some hope, although with Taylor at the crease, England could always feel safe.Taylor went aerial with confidence and was strong on the drive and cut. With Knight playing a supporting role, England were well on their way. Taylor brought up fifty off 33 balls and thoughb Knight was dismissed off the next ball England needed just 40 off 58 balls.South Africa claimed a few consolation wickets - van Niekerk took a stunning one-handed return catch in her follow through to dismiss Taylor and Ismail bowled Nat Sciver and Danielle Wyatt with full deliveries in the same over - but England reached the target with 4.3 overs to spare.

Now we have played, now we know how to deal with it,' said Malik on the sidelines of the Pakistan team's training session on the afternoon before the match.'We had miscalculated. It wasn't a typical T20 wicket where you look at 170 or 180. We know we have the best attack among all teams. But the batsmen have to take responsibility.

Otherwise one of them might have gone on to score 40-50. Here, 130-plus is a great score, unless the conditions change.'  It's unlikely that Pakistan will be worrying too much about its bowling.

By the time he began the final over, Ireland were still 20 short, and he demolished the stumps of Max Sorensen and George Dockrell to ensure there was no monkey business.Both sides were already eliminated but Netherlands were happy to get the consolation win..Only one Ireland player was allowed to bowl two overs and Dockrell's left-arm spin proved to be a wise choice, registering 3 for 7, and producing catching opportunities from three of his first five balls, two of which were taken. Seven dot balls out of 12, including an over in the Powerplay, was an astounding effort that might have brought victory.Dockrell found turn all the same as Netherlands' batsmen floundered against him.

Twice, he slogged Dockrell's left-arm spin to the legside. Kevin O'Brien spilled the first - a slice to long-off and a grimace from O'Brien as he landed heavily, but van der Merwe's next attempt was entirely bungled and he fell off the cue end at short third man.The coup de grace came in Dockrell's second over when his turn outdid Wesley Barresi as he came down the pitch, leaving Niall O'Brien with a simple stumping.Stephan Myburgh was dropped on 9 by Paul Stirling at deep midwicket but was still restrict to 27 from 18 balls. When he was run out against the penultimate ball, the damage had been limited. Dockrell bowled only one ball at him - the first ball of his spell - and got away with a leg bye off his waist.Stirling addressed Ireland's chase when he twice walked across his stumps in Tim van der Gugten's first over to flick him over fine leg for six. But Seelaar's thrilling intervention changed the complexion of the game and Stirling fell to the next ball, his ramp shot was collected at third man.At 28.3 off 2.3, Ireland had opportunity even in a six-over game for a settling period, but their plight worsened when Gary Wilson and Stuart Poynter departed against van der Merwe within three balls - Wilson falling to a reverse sweep, Poynton skying a rustic slog.With 25 needed from two, and only five wickets remaining, Netherlands were suddenly favourites.

If Saturday's big match involved goalposts and a large, inflated ball, India would lose no sleep over it.It is, instead, a cricket match. And not just any cricket match. It is the cricket match that causes a spike in the frequency of Venkatesh Prasad sightings on Indian television in the days leading up to it.

And Wasim Akram. And Kapil Dev. And Inzamam-ul-Haq.In the middle of all this, India and Pakistan, the cricket teams, will try and tune out the constant swirl of India-Pakistan.R Ashwin reinforced this during his pre-match conference on Friday, in a packed and insufficiently air-conditioned media room that evoked the pressure cooker clich'.""This rivalry is huge,"" he said. ""It's very hard to put a finger [on it] and say how huge it is. It's probably bigger than the Ashes is. As far as the Indians go and the Pakistanis go, I don't think they watch this as a game of cricket. It's more of a border rivalry, they want to get one up on each other.""So there is much more to this game rather than the game itself taking centrestage. As far as people are concerned, they put their emotions into it. For the players it's about trying to keep the emotions aside and playing the game the best we can.""It is something India have invariably managed to do against Pakistan at World events. In six World Cup meetings and four in the World T20, they have never lost. It's the sort of record that can put pressure on both sides, but on this occasion India are under more of it, given that they are playing at home, and given that they were beaten soundly by New Zealand in their first game and therefore have to win this one. Over recent years, Pakistan have usually been underdogs going into matches against India, and on this occasion have the cushion of a big win in their opening game against Bangladesh.""History can change, too,"" Waqar Younis, Pakistan's head coach, said. ""We are confident, a little more this time because [India] can go out of the tournament also. They will be under a lot of pressure. We have to take it positively. We have won the last match, so there are lots of things going in our favour, hopefully. Yes, there is no doubt that our history hasn't been so good but history can always be changed.""In all the previous games, the pressure was on Pakistani team. This is the first time that the pressure is more on India - not arising from victory or defeat at the hands of Pakistan but because this is a very big tournament. I have been a cricketer all my years and it is impossible that India won't be feeling the pressure. I am sure they will be feeling the pressure and we are going to take advantage of that.""India arrived in Kolkata on Wednesday night, but only had an optional training session - which only Suresh Raina, Ajinkya Rahane and Pawan Negi attended - on Thursday. Their first full session ahead of the match was on its eve. Ashwin said the light schedule was followed to allow the players to relax after the loss to New Zealand, and not put themselves under too much pressure.""I think it was more about trying and relaxing,"" he said. ""It had nothing to do with who we are playing, what game we are playing and all that. We have been on the road for the last three months and we thought it's time now to sit in the hotel room and revisit what we did in the last game. The best thing that we can do is to think for ourselves than sitting together and practising.""What happens after a game like that is we tend to go into nervous practice, try and overdo everything, and eventually end up going into the match a little more tired than we actually should be. That's the idea behind it.""India's practice session on Friday reflected this mindset, with the bowlers hardly taxing themselves and only the middle-order trio of Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni and Hardik Pandya spending any real length of time batting. Pakistan - after their unconvincing footballing warm-up - had a more traditional nets session, with the fast bowlers coming off their full run-ups and sending down a relatively large quota of deliveries.Two training philosophies, neither definitely better or worse than the other, both geared to the same end: to keep minds focused on bat and ball, to tune out the crowds and the last-minute venue changes and the razzmatazz of the build-up. As Virat Kohli said before the start of the tournament, ""On the field is the safest and quietest place for you"". And until they actually get on the field, the match will live a parallel existence that has little to do with the actual cricket. It might as well be a football game where Mohammad Irfan and a magically young-again Venkatesh Prasad are goalkeepers in a penalty shootout.",3/18/16,India Pakistan look to tune out India Pakistan hy,,,1447,"NAGPUR: Australia began their title defence with a six-wicket win against South Africa at the VCA Stadium in Nagpur. It was vice-captain Alex Blackwell and captain Meg Lanning who led the way to chase down 103 easily in the end, after they were reduced to 9 for 3 in the fourth over.South Africa had an excellent launch pad at 69 without loss in 12 overs after opting to bat. Then they fell into a crater courtesy rush of blood, indecision against spin and a number of misguided strokes to huff and puff to 102 for 6. As hard as they tried, defending it was never going to be easy against the masters of the big occasion who are gunning for their fourth successive title.Eventually, the batting meltdown played a big part in the result, as Lanning and Blackwell allayed fears with an unbroken 52-run fifth-wicket stand off just 38 balls to see Australia home with nine balls to spare.South Africa showed they were up for a fight as Dane van Niekerk did the early running by making 45 in a 72-run opening stand with Trisha Chetty, before Australia strangulated them.While Ellyse Perry hustled the batsmen with pace, Lauren Cheatle's canny variations resulted in South Africa's middle order having to manufacture strokes that didn't connect. Chetty's scratchy 34 eventually helped them cross the 100-run mark.Australia's thoughts of the chase being a walk in the park were firmly put on the backburner. Alyssa Healy walked across to flick, only to find her leg stump flattened to give the fired-up Shabnim Ismail an early sniff. Perry bottom-edged a cut to the wicketkeeper, while Ellyse Villani chopped on to leave Australia in tatters before they could reach double figures.Lanning's illness that kept her off the field for most parts of South Africa's innings meant she could come in either after 30 minutes or the fall of the fifth wicket. But the conclusion of Ismail's opening burst took with it the sting in their attack as Blackwell and Jess Jonassen added 44 for the fourth wicket. When Jonassen stepped out to be stumped, the game was back in the balance as Australia slipped to 53 for 4, needing 50 off 47 balls.Lanning struggled to run as she helped herself to three fours to bring the equation down to 23 off the last four overs.

They tightened up on their discipline in the field but still gave away more extras than their opposition - six wides compared to two from Afghanistan - and did not show the kind of killer instinct that they will need later in the tournament.They also suffered an injury concern. JP Duminy left the field four balls into Afghanistan's chase with a hamstring strain and was unable to take any further part in the match. Duminy has only just found form again and his availability will be important for the rest of the World T20.Quinton de Kock picked up from where he left off two days ago and dominated the opening passages of play. Hashim Amla may have wanted to catch up but after one four, gifted a catch to Asghar Stanikzai at mid-off.South Africa held de Villiers back and sent in Faf du Plessis at No.3. The strategy worked. Du Plessis took on the spin from Mohammad Nabi while de Kock continued to attack in the Powerplay. South Africa finished it on 66 for 1 and 60 of those runs came in boundaries.When the fielding restrictions were lifted, Rashid put the brakes on with the first boundary-less over of the innings, but du Plessis did not want things to slow down too much. He picked up the pace before being run-out and de Villiers was soon at the crease.Afghanistan were not under threat immediately while de Villiers settled in and de Kock nicked off. After conceding just 19 runs in three overs after the halfway stage of the South African innings, Afghanistan might have been hopeful of pulling South Africa even further back. But Duminy and de Villiers were wise to the need to accelerate and began to push for runs.It was up to David Miller to take them to 200 after de Villiers was dismissed. Twenty runs off the final over ensured South Africa had a second straight 200-plus score.However, Mohammad Shahzad threatened to gun down that total all by himself. He began fearlessly against Kagiso Rabada and Kyle Abbott and plundered 32 runs off the first two overs. His partner Noor Ali Zadran did not face a ball until the third over and then, it was only to return the strike to Shahzad.Morris was brought on in the fourth over and showed improvement from previous performances. He started by holding his length back but then steamed in with a delivery just under 150kph - full and straightening - which splayed Shahzad's stumps.Asghar Stanikzai and was caught behind in Morris' next over but Gulbadin Naib kept Afghanistan in it and targeted David Wiese, South Africa's replacement for Steyn. Afghanistan reached 10 overs on 103 for 2, 11 runs ahead of where South Africa were at the same stage. Then, Gulbadin was caught behind, Noor Ali was stumped, and Afghanistan were wobbling, still needing 100 runs off eight overs. Their chase was over then and South Africa had the chance to drill home an advantage.Instead, they allowed Afghanistan to drag it out.

It is therefore a priority to have all of our players competing and available for selection.'Relations between the board and team have often been poisonous in recent years with players furious over what they see as inadequate financial rewards.A pay dispute two years ago led to the team flying home in the middle of a tour of India and the players only reluctantly agreed to sign contracts for the World T20 a few weeks before the tournament began.Many senior players, such as Chris Gayle, no longer play Test matches instead turning out in T20 leagues where they can earn more money in six weeks than they are paid by their board in a year.When the West Indies were thrashed by Australia in a Test series at the turn of the year, Gayle and Sammy were both unavailable for selection as they were playing in Australia's Big Bash T20 tournament.Amid growing fears that the proliferation of T20 leagues is turning some players away from Test matches, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has said it wants to draw up a time table to avoid clashes.Many of the West Indies T20 champions are expected to play in the IPL which begins this coming weekend and ends in late May.'We are aware of that schedule hence the plan to meet at that time', 'said Cameron.

Finch and Suresh Raina then took the attack to the pacers, both capitalizing on loose deliveries along with intermittent swipes.After Raina holed out to mid-on in the sixth over, Finch peppered the boundary with deft touch and exemplary placement, particular behind square on the off side.His 47-ball 74 saw 12 boundaries, and it required a moment of brilliance from the debutant Pardeep Sahu to remove him. Sahu drew Finch forward but the legspinner beat him in flight and loop, as Saha completed his second stumping off the innings.The rest of the innings was a mere formality as Dinesh Karthik accrued his runs in typical fashion, with his sweeps being the most productive.Kings XI were given an ideal start by their openers - M Vijay and Manan Vohra - who saw off the swinging new ball before getting stuck into their work. A blend of crisp drives and flicks earned the pair a fifty-run stand within the Powerplay.The spreading field did not impede Vohra, as he manufactured boundaries with the use of his feet off the spinners.However, momentum shifted rapidly as Ravindra Jadeja struck twice in consecutive overs to remove the openers. Dwayne Bravo undid Glenn Maxwell and David Miller in the space of three balls with contrasting yorkers.Bravo became the first bowler to 300 T20 wickets with his new weapon - the slow, dipping yorker that deceived Miller.Suddenly, debutant Marcus Stoinis and Wriddhiman Saha were left to rebuild a rollicking start. The pair were forced to use the large Mohali pockets to find their runs, but struggled to find the boundaries towards the end.

It is not like the side is short of hitters but Jos Buttler caught fire only after the spark provided by McClenaghan's eight-ball 20. The events between the 11th and the 15th overs of the chase decided the winner of the match - Mumbai, by six wickets.McClenaghan's responsibility - under normal circumstances - was to slip into Lasith Malinga's shoes. Be the wicket-taker at the start and the enforcer at the end. Today, he was asked to disrupt the Kolkata Knight Riders' rhythm. And he was given the freedom to do so. Every single shot played by the New Zealand fast bowler was a slog. His second, third and fourth balls cleared the Eden Gardens boundaries. The eighth - a wide full toss that he tried to slog sweep - led to his downfall but by then Mumbai had regained lost momentum. And Buttler simply ran with it.A straight drive against chinaman Brad Hogg was followed by a pulled six. The equation shrunk from 101 off 60 balls to 49 off 30. A scoop to the fine leg boundary - which established Buttler's finesse - and two lofted cover drives - which established his power - deflated Knight Riders. Gautam Gambhir, who had taken the record (27) for the most fifties in the IPL earlier in the night, watched the ball soar and the chances for his team sink with every minute Buttler was on strike.When Buttler eventually fell for 41 off 22 balls, the Mumbai captain, Rohit Sharma, back at his preferred opening position, provided more evidence of why he should be given as many overs as possible in a T20 game. Rohit held the innings together and even finished it off with an array of beautiful shots - a straight six and a deft glide to third man. He followed those up with an outrageous sweep taking an overpitched delivery coming at him with the express pace of Andre Russell from around the wicket, and deposited it at the midwicket boundary.

In doing so, they also bucked the season's early trend of chasing teams prevailing.AB de Villiers (82) and Virat Kohli (75) provided a visual treat courtesy a fine cocktail of fineness and brute force in a 157-run second-wicket stand, before Shane Watson announced himself by muscling three successive sixes in an over from Karn Sharma. The final flourish was lent by Sarfaraz Khan, who in his typically unorthodox fashion, paddled and reverse-paddled his way to an unbeaten 10-ball 35 as Royal Challengers finished with 227 for 4.Deflated and dejected, Sunrisers went for broke, wiping out 83 for the loss of Shikhar Dhawan in eight overs. David Warner, who returned to open after a brief flirtation in the middle order with Australia in the World T20, showed why he is one of the most feared white-ball strikers. He muscled three sixes and five fours in a 21-ball half-century before falling into the short-ball trap laid by Watson.The pressure of the required rate eventually got to Sunrisers and the chase went cold as the team lost Warner, Naman Ojha, Henriques and Deepak Hooda in the space of 17 deliveries, meaning they could only muster 182 for 6. Parvez Rasool was the pick of Royal Challengers' bowlers, returning 1 for 31 in a crafty spell of offspin bowling, even as Watson and Yuzvendra Chahal, the legspiner, chipped away with two wickets.Chris Gayle's dismissal for 1 in the second over of the match to Bhuvneshwar Kumar, when the ball brushed the thigh pad and deflected onto the leg stump, was a rare moment to cheer for a listless Sunrisers bowling attack that was further depleted when Ashish Nehra, their pace spearhead, hobbled off the field after just 2.1 overs. That resulted in a batting feast for two men in a murderous mood as Royal Challengers blasted 139 off the last 10 overs.The only semblance of respect from Kohli and de Villiers came early on when Mustafizur Rahman, making his IPL debut, troubled them with his cutters. Once the job of seeing off his initial burst - a two-over spell - was done, they let loose. Sarfaraz's unbeaten 44-run stand off just 15 deliveries with Kedar Jadhav ensured Royal Challengers had momentum firmly by their side at the break.Dhawan's early wicket to Rasool was a setback for Sunrisers, but Warner's muscle kept his team in the hunt as Kohli rang in the changes in a bid to pull things back. Adam Milne's second spell, in which he had Moises Henriques mistime a pull to midwicket, opened the game up. Once Royal Challengers had one foot in the door, it was a simple matter of forcing it open, which they did quite easily.

The groundwork was laid during the course of his second-wicket stand of 107 with de Villiers before Daredevils hit back with a tremendous exhibition of late-overs bowling courtesy the returning Mohammed Shami and Chris Morris, who conceded only 27 off the last four overs.Daredevils were dealt an early blow when Shreyas Iyer was dismissed by Shane Watson but it had little effect on de Kock as he pierced a packed off-side field for three fours off the offspinner Parvez Rasool in the second over.De Kock was particularly punishing through the off side, a majority of his runs coming behind square.

The end result was a wagon wheel with spokes all around the wicket.De Kock's sparkling form helped Daredevils ride a trough when Sanju Samson struggled to play his shots, but his dismissal in the sixth over turned their fortunes. Nair and de Kock got stuck in against Yuzvendra Chahal, Harshal Patel and David Wiese, whose combined tally at one point was 78 conceded off seven overs. Their predictability put immense pressure on Watson to deliver with the ball as the equation came down to 56 off the last six overs.De Kock brought up his century off his 48th ball. Once into the home stretch, there was a sense of inevitability to the game. After De Kock walked off to a round of applause from Watson, who had him caught behind, Duminy struck the winning runs, Chahal fielding his straight punch but giving away an overthrow with an underarm flick to try and catch Nair out of his crease.''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''",4/18/16,Delhi beat Bangalore in high scoring IPL encounter,,,1633,"MELBOURNE: South Africa are reluctant to play a day-night test during their tour of Australia as they have no experience with the pink ball, the Proteas' players association chief has said.",4/19/16,South Africa players against day night,,,1634,"BERLIN: World number ones Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams completed a clean sweep for tennis as they won the Laureus Sportsman and Sportswoman of the Year awards on Monday.In a glitzy ceremony in the German capital, hosted by U.S. actor Bill Murray, Serbia's Djokovic beat Barcelona footballer Lionel Messi, sprinter Usain Bolt and Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton among others for the top men's award at the annual ceremony.Djokovic and American Williams, who fought off competition from footballer Carli Lloyd and Jamaican sprinter Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce among others, were rewarded for dominating their sport last year, with each winning three of the four grand slams.Both athletes picked up the top prize for the third time, with Williams having previously won it in 2003 and 2010 while Djokovic was also victorious in 2012 and 2015.Golfer Jordan Spieth won the Breakthrough of the Year award after capturing his first two majors at the 2015 U.S. Masters and U.S. Open, while New Zealand's All Blacks won Team of the Year award following their World Cup victory.There was some joy for the host nation as well with triathlete Jan Frodeno grabbing the Action Sportsperson of the Year prize.Dutch footballer and coach Johan Cruyff, who died of cancer in March, was posthumously awarded the Spirit of Sport award.

Mumbai's defeat was their third in four matches.It only took four balls for Bhuvneshwar Kumar to strike, though it was swing rather than seam that did the damage. With Kieron Pollard out due to food poisoning, Mumbai had brought in Martin Guptill, and his debut innings in the IPL was terminated by a perfectly pitched outswinger that kissed his edge through to the wicketkeeper.Parthiv Patel looked distinctly uncomfortable against the swinging ball, playing and missing repeatedly before he was bowled by a back-of-the-hand slower ball from Barinder Sran that jagged in like a left-arm wristspinner's googly. Then came a self-inflicted wound - Rohit, who came in at No. 4, running himself out while looking for a suicidal single. When Jos Buttler, surprised by extra pace from Sran, gloved an attempted pull in the 11th over, they were 60 for 4 and going nowhere.At the crease now were Ambati Rayudu, who had been promoted to No. 3, and Krunal Pandya, who had been promoted to No. 6 ahead of his brother Hardik, who had batted at No. 3 in all of Mumbai's previous matches. All the meddling with the batting order indicated a muddled think-tank, but Rayudu and Krunal made the most of their opportunities.Moises Henriques and the left-arm spinner Bipul Sharma varied their pace cleverly in the middle overs. But Bipul, who had gone for only 14 off his first three overs, was struck three successive sixes by Krunal in the 14th over.

In 13 games this season, 12 have been won by the chasing team.Put in to bat, Kings XI lost Manan Vohra early when he flicked Morne Morkel to deep square leg but M Vijay looked in rhythm, scything drives and cuts before failing to pick a googly from Piyush Chawla.The stage was set for either of David Miller or Glenn Maxwell to fire their side back into the contest, but Knight Riders' experienced bowling attack strangled their strong middle order.With two left-handers batting - Marsh and Miller - Gautam Gambhir turned to Yusuf Pathan for the first time this season. The move reaped rewards instantly when Miller edged Yusuf's first ball and Uthappa took a sharp catch.Maxwell soon resorted to a switch-hit off Sunil Narine, but Kings XI's season was summed up when he hammered it to extra cover. Narine's remodeled action returned two wickets in a frugal spell with an economy rate of 5.50.In a format where teams target implausible numbers during the second half of an innings, Knight Riders' spinners ensured Kings XI could only rebuild after leaving them at 94 for 5 in the 15th over.In between, Marsh used swift footwork to accumulate runs and was particularly effective square of the wicket, on both sides. He got to his fifty in the last over with a sweetly-timed lofted drive over long-on. Along with Kyle Abbott, he took Andre Russell's first over - the last of the innings - for 18 to lift Kings XI to 138.Kings XI needed a miraculous start but Uthappa and Gambhir pushed Knight Riders closer to the target with nine boundaries in a 65-run Powerplay, the most productive in this season.The seamers, Sandeep Sharma and Abbott, were inconsistent but when they found their lengths, Uthappa cleared the infield with lofted strokes on the up, on a pitch offering even bounce and carry.Uthappa eased himself to his first fifty of the season off just 24 balls but his premeditated sweep resulted in his dismissal, as he played around a full delivery from Pardeep Sahu. Gambhir looked set for another fifty before a leading edge was acrobatically taken by Glenn Maxwell, running in from deep midwicket.Axar Patel removed Manish Pandey and Shakib Al Hasan, but Suryakumar Yadav and Yusuf took Knight Riders home with 17 balls to spare.",4/20/16,Kolkata thrash Punjab to go on top in IPL,,,1639,"ANCIENT OLYMPIA, Greece: The official countdown to this year's Rio de Janeiro Olympics began on Thursday when the torch was lit at the site of the ancient Games, with organisers hoping it will shift attention away from Brazil's political and financial turmoil.On a glorious spring day with the sun burning hot above the ancient stadium in Olympia, an actress playing a high priestess lit the torch from the rays of the sun at the temple of Hera, using a parabolic mirror.Greek gymnastics world champion Lefteris Petrounias started the domestic relay after receiving the flame.Brazilian double Olympic volleyball champion Giovane Gavio was due to be the second runner.A refugee will also carry the torch during the Greek leg of the relay before Brazilian organisers receive it in a handover at the Panathenian stadium on April 27 in Athens, site of the first modern Olympics in 1896.Brazil will start its relay on May 3 in the capital Brasilia with the first of 12,000 runners, carrying it through 300 cities and towns in the 26 Brazilian states and ending in Rio on the day of the opening ceremony.Preparations for the first Games in South America, which run from Aug. 5-21, have been plagued by problems and a shortage of cash for organisers as the country is experiencing its worst recession in decades.""(The torch lighting) brings a message that can and will unite our dear Brazil,"" Rio Games chief Carlos Nuzman said in his speech.Brazil President Dilma Rousseff, who cancelled her trip to ancient Olympia, is facing impeachment and federal prosecutors are investigating Olympic projects for corruption.""Despite the difficulties that Brazil is facing today, the flame is a timeless reminder that we are all part of the same humanity,"" International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach said.""Rio de Janeiro will provide a spectacular to showcase the best of the human spirit.

Jos Buttler and Kieron Pollard, returning from food poisoning, flexed their muscles by hitting five sixes between them, and Mumbai recorded their second win in five matches.Mumbai, who opted to bowl, were staring at a 200-plus target as Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers feasted on some friendly bowling during the course of a 59-run stand, before the unheralded players, in what was billed as a battle of two heavyweight teams, rose to the occasion.Krunal Pandya's twin strikes to get rid of Kohli and de Villiers in the space of five deliveries stunned Royal Challengers. Shane Watson fell not long after, but then Travis Head, on IPL debut, and Sarfaraz Khan lifted Royal Challengers from 99 for 4 to 170 for 7.KL Rahul was put through a short-ball test in a hostile burst by Mitchell McClenaghan, during which he was hit hard on the helmet. After the early jitters, though, he ramped and slapped his way to 23 before being caught in the slips. Kohli and de Villiers then counterpunched before the cluster of wickets resulted in a complete breakdown in momentum.Head took his time to settle in before exhibiting his ball-striking power to swat Hardik Pandya for six over deep square leg in the 15th over. Sarfaraz showed there is more to his game than just scoops and paddles as he milked the spinners before clubbing Jasprit Bumrah for two successive sixes in the final over.Mumbai lost Parthiv Patel in the second over of the chase, but Varun Aaron's third over, which went for 19, brought their innings back on track. Once Royal Challengers' uncapped Indian bowlers were summoned, a game that was only marginally tilted in Mumbai's favour turned decisively in their direction.

With Pakistan, it is more trying to get the routine right but it is also about the preparation off the field regarding fitness, Flower told ESPNCricinfo.'You not only need that in fielding and bowling but equally in batting. If you are physically fit it will definitely lead to a good life style and better judgement at the crease he said.Flower said, 'our players are very inconsistent with the way they practice. They do work on their weak areas but they could do a lot more. When you are an international player you should be waking up and asking yourself what I have to do more to improve myself.

The sensor is the size of a small coin and uses an accompanying smart phone app to detect the nicks.The on-field umpires will have to attach the smart phones to their jackets to film each ball so that instant replays and ball trajectories can be replayed and monitored, a prominent sports website www.sportskeeda.com reported.The tiny sensor which costs 25 (AUD46) can easily be fixed to the bat for the phone to film and monitor the ball.Hawkins, who was a former county player and a missile guidance expert, has confirmed that the technology is almost ready to be used and might be introduced into amateur cricket in England soon.Hawkins had been watching a Hampshire cricket league match last year and had been left very disappointed to see a batsman 'stand his ground after being out caught behind as the umpire failed to detect the edge.That incident has led Hawkins to come up with his ingenious technological innovation to change cricket.Batsmen have always not walked but what really got me was that after the inevitable bout of sledging from the fielders 'the batsman said I know I nicked it and you know I did but so what it wasn't given Hawkins was quoted as saying.

Every time they play it is an away series which is really hard. It is always difficult playing outside your condition and it has dented Pakistan cricket', in an exclusive interview with a private news channel Arthur said.The South African-born coach said that he picked up the role of coaching Pakistan team considering it as a big challenge and that he was looking forward to deliver results but demanded consistency in team decisions for any positive outcome.'I think it's a great challenge. Pakistan cricket has struggled a little bit in the last couple of years and certainly I am keen to bring it back to its rightful place in the ranking and the rightful place in world cricket', he said.Talking about his first assignment with Pakistan team, the tour of England, Arthur said that the series will be a big challenge for the players and key will be to learn how to perform outside the United Arab Emirates, where Pakistan has been playing most of its cricket recently.'Pakistan has got a wonderful group of bowlers. We need to work on batting, particularly outside the UAE, and that will be key. Also we need to bring the fielding up to standards of international level,' he added.'It will be a challenge for players that how they are going to handle the conditions outside the UAE and Pakistan.

So technically we need to work really hard to get our batting 100 percent right', said 47-year-old former cricketer.During Arthur's coaching stint, South Africa reached the top in all the three formats.Arthur said he is confident that Pakistan can also achieve the top position but warned that it can be achieved only if there is consistency in team decisions. 'You need opportunity and time to build the team in order to achieve the result. We need to be consistent with our selections, we need to be consistent with our players and we need to allow players to express themselves without any consequences.'That's the key, players need to find out how they go about and play in certain situations. I hope we can give the players that experience and make sure they go forward', he said.Arthur said he did not feel any language barrier while working with Pakistani players during the Pakistan Super League earlier this year, where he coached the team Karachi Kings but added that he would still look to have a local coach as his assistant so that his message is not lost in translation.'I will have a local coach as my assistant who can deliver my message to the guys.

The proposal is expected to be added to the agenda for the ICC's annual general meeting in Edinburgh at the end of June for formal discussion.An informal sounding out of broadcasters has begun about adding the tournaments to the recent $2?billion ('1.4?billion) rights deal signed with Star Sports in 2014 that runs until 2023. That deal included a World Twenty20 this year and in 2020 after the ICC decided to place its three global tournaments (the World Cup, Champions Trophy and World Twenty20) on a four year cycle.But the collapse of the Twenty20 Champions League, which featured domestic teams from around the world, has left a hole in the calendar in September-October, a time which is suitable for cricket in seven of the nine Test playing nations.Sources have confirmed the ICC has explored the possibility of holding the men's World Twenty20 in the West Indies in 2018, possibly as a run in or at the same as the women's version is due to take place in the Caribbean. But the problem with the Caribbean is the time difference makes it incompatible with the Indian market, where the vast broadcast deals are on offer.Another possibility is South Africa, although the government there recently banned its cricket board from hosting global tournament because it had failed to meet racial quotas. The UAE has the infrastructure to host the tournament and the time difference works well with India. England is a non starter because this country is already hosting the 2017 Champions Trophy and 2019 World Cup.The recent World Twenty20 was hailed by the ICC for bringing in record television ratings. The group match between Pakistan and India was watched by 83?million people and in this country the pulsating final between England and West Indies brought Sky Sports a peak of 2.45?million viewers, the channel's highest rating for a cricket match.Tweets about the World Twenty20 received 5.75?billion impressions and the ICC claimed 46?million people engaged with the tournament on Facebook.

Bairstow's 54 not out from 67 balls took the attack back to Sri Lanka, who nevertheless remained firmly in the contest at 171 for 5, thanks to Dasun Shanaka's sensational debut breakthroughs.After being put into bat on a morning when bowling first was a no-brainer for both captains, England's openers were obliged to rein in the extravagant strokeplay that has coloured so much of their cricket in recent months - a situation that might have been tailor-made for Alastair Cook. He began the match needing another 36 runs to reach 10,000 Test runs, and after getting off the mark with a sixth-ball clip for four through midwicket, appeared well set for the long grind until Shanaka's introduction, in the 18th over of the day, tore up the pre-conceived script.Shanaka launched his Test career with a maiden before striking with the first ball of his second over. Cook had been leaving the ball with his usual sangfroid for most of his 52 deliveries, but having creamed one cover drive off Nuwan Pradeep, he was drawn into another from the slower, wobblier Shanaka. The full length outside off left him a touch, and Cook scuffed an edge through to Dinesh Chandimal, the keeper. He was gone for 16, and still needs another 20 runs to notch up a landmark that has been on his conscience since the start of the South Africa tour in December.Three balls later, however, such thoughts had been whisked out of England's minds. Nick Compton - whose anxieties cannot have been aided by his team-mates' struggles to impose themselves - poked with caution at a perfect off-stump line and length, to squeeze a low edge through to Lahiru Thirimanne at first slip. He was gone for a duck as Shanaka became only the third bowler in Test history, and the first since Richard Johnson in 2003, to claim two wickets before conceding his first career run.And, as if that was not enough of an impact on debut, Shanaka then added England's main man to his tally, as Joe Root - in such golden touch in all formats - was also drawn into a drive that scudded to Kusal Mendis at third slip.It was a dream start for Shanaka, who had been awarded his Test cap by Mahela Jayawardene before the start of play, and a timely boost for a beleaguered Sri Lanka squad too, who began the match knowing that Dhammika Prasad, their matchwinning seamer on this ground two years ago, will miss the whole Test series after flying home to resolve a shoulder injury.By tea, however, Hales and Bairstow had provided their team with a steadying hand, as a forecast rain shower swept in from the Pennines to delay the resumption of play.",5/19/16,Hales Bairstow rescue England with 88 run unbeaten stand,,,1767,"LEEDS: Alastair Cook's bid to become the first England batsman to reach 10,000 Test runs had been relegated to an afterthought by lunch on the first morning of the first Test at Headingley, as the Sri Lanka debutant Dasun Shanaka claimed three wickets for one run in the space of eight balls to cut a swathe through England's much-heralded top order.By lunch, Cook had been dismissed for 16 - still 20 runs shy of his landmark - with Nick Compton and Joe Root, the local hero and newly-crowned England Test player of the year, both following for ducks in a sensational ten-minute spell before lunch.It was left to Alex Hales, who had been growing in confidence on 38 after an anxious first hour, and England's own debutant, James Vince, to glue the innings together. Vince had yet to get off the mark after 15 balls of watchful defence, as England settled for a lunchtime scoreline - and a definite bout of indigestion - of 57 for 3.Shanaka had been brought on to bowl the 19th over of the innings with England apparently looking solid on 44 for 0 after Cook and Hales had seen off the new-ball danger of Shaminda Eranga and Nuwan Pradeep.Instead, having launched his Test career with a maiden, Shanaka struck with his seventh delivery to tempt Cook with a fuller length outside off, and scuffed an edge through to Dinesh Chandimal, the keeper.Then, three balls later, Compton poked with caution at a perfect off-stump line and length, to squeeze a low edge through to Lahiru Thirimanne at first slip.Shanaka then added England's main man to his tally, as Root - in such golden touch in all formats - was also drawn into a drive as Shanaka's wobbly medium-pace left his shot just a fraction and scudded to Kusal Mendis at third slip instead.It was a dream start for Shanaka and a timely boost for a beleaguered Sri Lanka squad too, who began the match knowing that Dhammika Prasad, their matchwinning seamer on this ground two years ago, will miss the whole Test series after flying home to resolve a shoulder injury.The second hour of the session also featured a lively but unsuccessful introduction for Sri Lanka's pacy young quick bowler, Dushmantha Chameera, as well as a typically accurate probe from the spinner, Rangana Herath, whose solitary over was blocked out for a maiden by Hales before the break.Both sides are wearing black armbands in recognition of the floods that are currently affecting Sri Lanka.'",5/19/16,Sri Lankas Shanaka debut triple stings England,,,1768,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan head coach Mickey Arthur feels that if there would be a role for Shahid Afridi in Pakistan cricket then he will be brought back.,5/19/16,Mickey Arthur need arises Shahid Afridi may recalled,,,1769,English Premier League champions Leicester City paid a visit to Bangkok's glittering Grand Palace on Thursday and signed a well-wishing book for the country's revered monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej.,5/19/16,English champions Leicester visit Thai kings,,,1770,LONDON: The concept of day-night test found a new taker in England with board chairman Colin Graves confirming the country will host a twilight test.,5/19/16,England host day night,,,1771,"A Chinese magnate has agreed to buy historic English football club Aston Villa, the latest in a series of investments from China into football worldwide as President Xi Jinping looks to make the country a global powerhouse in the sport.The deal, reportedly worth 60 million pounds ($88 million), will see the chairman of little-known Recon Group, Xia Jiantong, become the first mainland Chinese to fully own an English team.Under the leadership of Xi, an avid fan, China has made it a goal to one day win the World Cup, and has ploughed huge amounts of investment into grassroots academies, television rights, transfer deals for overseas players and investment in clubs abroad.More broadly, Beijing is aiming to grow the domestic sports market to 5 trillion yuan ($782 billion) by 2025, about five times its current scale.China's biggest overseas investment in football so far occurred in December last year, when a consortium led by state-backed China Media Capital took a $400 million stake in the owner of Villa's far larger and wealthier rival, Manchester City.The Villa deal, however, with 100 percent ownership, is not just an investment.""The Chinese ownership now get to decide how to run the club,"" said Mark Dreyer, Beijing-based founder of sports information website China Sports Insider.Crosstown arch-rivals Birmingham City are also run from Asia, following the 2009 takeover by Hong Kong businessman Carson Yeung.Villa's American owner Randy Lerner, who put the club on the market in 2014, struck the deal after former English champions Villa suffered a miserable season that left them relegated from the country's top football league.Recon Group, Xia's privately owned holding company, owns a controlling interest in five publicly listed companies on the Hong Kong and Chinese stock exchanges.The deal with American-educated Xia, 39, ends an unhappy tenure for Lerner, who bought the midlands club for 62.2 million pounds in 2006. Fans have openly demonstrated against his continued involvement with Villa, who were European champions in 1982 and have won the English top-flight title seven times.The club ended the recent season bottom of the English Premier League table, with only half the number of points of the next worst team.""Aston Villa's relegation really played in their favour,"" said Fredrik van Huynh, Shanghai-based director of HHC Sports Group.

Hales, on 86, was in sight of his maiden test century when he skied spinner Rangana Herath to deep extra cover.Moeen Ali (nought) and Broad (two) were dismissed by Dushmantha Chameera in the same over but Bairstow, dropped on 70, completed his second Test hundred and celebrated the achievement enthusiastically on his home ground.Bairstow found a solid partner in Steven Finn, the pair adding 56 for the ninth wicket before the former skied a catch to mid-on off Chameera.Sri Lanka made a dreadful start to their reply as experienced fast bowlers Anderson and Broad exploited the conditions superbly.Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva and Kusal Mendis all edged catches to wicketkeeper Bairstow, leaving the tourists in deep trouble at 12 for three.Dinesh Chandimal, on 15, was well held by James Vince at third slip off Ben Stokes before Anderson trapped captain Angelo Mathews lbw for 34 and then dismissed Dasun Shanaka first ball that the batsman nicked to Bairstow.Herath was smartly caught by Stokes in the slips off Anderson for one, Chameera (2) drove Broad to Finn at mid-off and Lahiru Thirimanne, on 22, was caught by Finn at mid-on off Broad.Anderson completed his 19th five-wicket haul in Tests and outstanding figures of five for 16 when he had Shaminda Eranga caught by Bairstow down the leg-side.'",5/20/16,Sri Lanka skittled out for 91 in reply to Englands 298,,,1774,"LEEDS: England took command on the second afternoon of the first Test at Headingley after Jonny Bairstow played 'a brilliant counter-punching innings of 140 and later added three catches behind the stumps. With a total of 298 to defend, Stuart Broad and James Anderson produced another classy display of seam and swing bowling to leave the Sri Lankans rattled on 43 for 3 at tea.It was a situation far removed from the 83-for-5 scoreline that had confronted Bairstow when he walked out to bat shortly after lunch on the first day. And with the new ball jagging alarmingly from a full length as Broad and Anderson brought all of their huge experience to bear, it took a gutsy response from Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal, Sri Lanka's most experienced pairing, to reach the break without further damage.Faced with grey skies and a packed cordon, Sri Lanka's openers, Dimuth Karunaratne and Kaushal Silva betrayed their anxieties in the very first over, when they hesitated so long over a quick single that they could have ended up shaking hands in the middle of the pitch.Instead, they simply waved goodbye in the space of five deliveries as, first, Broad straightened one off the seam to kiss the edge of the left-handed Karunaratne, who departed for a 12-ball duck, before Anderson drew level with Kapil Dev on 434 career wickets by finding some extra lift to dispose of Silva for 11.One over later, and Broad had two wickets in three balls as he went wide on the crease to spear an angled full-length ball into Kusal Mendis' forward defence, for Bairstow to snaffle the slenderest of deflections behind the stumps.Chandimal and Mathews, however, stood firm in a 31-run stand before the interval.The story of the day, however, remained Bairstow's happy homecoming - a second Test century and his first at his Yorkshire home. Continuing the theme that Bairstow and his fellow not-out batsman, Alex Hales, had established on the first afternoon, England's sixth-wicket pair extended their stand to 141 to banish the memories of the top-order wobble, when five wickets had tumbled for 34 runs.At the other end, Hales wound his neck in and banished all risk from his game as he set his sights on the remaining 29 runs he needed for his maiden Test century. But he faced with a change of tempo as Rangana Herath came into the attack, Hales' patience snapped for good. In Herath's second over, he skipped down the track and failed to reach the pitch of the ball with an ambitious wallop over the covers. A fast flat leading edge fizzed out to Dushmantha Chameera at deep extra cover, who pouched the offering with a well-judged dive.If Hales' failing had been to linger too long, then a different criticism could be levelled at Moeen Ali. England's No. 8 had admitted before the match that he had lost a bit of confidence in being slated to come in so low for his country, but the hasty manner in which he came and went didn't exactly enhance his case for a promotion. He had failed to score from his first seven deliveries when he drove too firmly at his eighth, from Chameera, and lobbed a simple catch off the inside edge and pad, to Mendis under the helmet at short leg.It was a timely reward for the slippery Chameera, bowling only his second over of the day. He had erred on the short side in his fruitless first day's work, but was soon celebrating two wickets in the space of five deliveries when Broad drove flat-footedly at a hint of width outside off and spread-eagled his own stumps via an inside edge.Bairstow simply stared down the track, rather nonplussed by the clatter of wickets in his midst. But he didn't have to wait long to reframe the story of the session. From the first ball of Chameera's next over, Bairstow drilled a drive into the covers, paused as a wild shy came in at the non-striker's end, then galloped through with glee as the ball zipped through for overthrows to gift him his second century and his first on home soil.",5/20/16,England strike against Sri Lanka after Bairstow century,,,1775,"LEEDS: Jonny Bairstow brought up his second Test century, and his first on his home ground at Headingley, as England continued their fightback on the second morning of the first Test against Sri Lanka. However, with Alex Hales falling short in his own quest for three figures, Sri Lanka battled back with three wickets in the second hour of the session, and will be armed with a brand-new ball when play resumes after lunch.Continuing the theme that Hales and Bairstow had established on the first afternoon, the pair extended their sixth-wicket stand to 141 to banish the memories of England's top-order wobble, when five wickets had tumbled for 34 runs. Bairstow was once again the aggressor, as befits a man in supreme form on his Yorkshire home ground - his last two innings at the venue have been 246 and 198.Bairstow outscored his partner by three to one throughout their morning resumption, capitalising on too much width as both Sri Lanka openers, Shaminda Eranga and Nuwan Pradeep, offered opportunities to fillet the third-man boundary. He did enjoy one clear moment of good fortune however, on 70, when Pradeep failed to gather a sharp return catch to his right, as Bairstow scuffed a drive back down the track.At the other end, Hales wound his neck in and banished all risk from his game as he set his sights on the remaining 29 runs he needed for his maiden Test century. It was a grind, as he routinely refused to chase anything outside his eyeline, except for one clear opportunity on 82, when Dimuth Karunaratne failed to cling onto a flying edge at slip off the bowling off Angelo Mathews.It could have been the slice of luck that Hales needed. But four runs later, and faced with a change of tempo as Rangana Herath came into the attack, Hales' patience snapped for good. In Herath's second over, he skipped down the track and failed to reach the pitch of the ball with an ambitious wallop over the covers. A fast flat leading edge fizzed out to Dushmantha Chameera at deep extra cover, who pouched the offering with a well-judged dive.Hales was visibly distraught, lingering at the crease for several seconds and looking as though he wanted to snap his errant bat in two. Though he belatedly acknowledged the crowd as he dragged himself from the field, he knew that he had thrown away a priceless opportunity to silence those who doubt his credentials as a Test match opener.It could have set his summer up at the first opportunity. Instead, having added 15 runs to his overnight 71 in 52 deliveries, with a dropped catch thrown in the mix as well, he will know that the jury remains out. At least, for those of a superstitious bent, he had guaranteed his fate would be different to the last two England openers to make a maiden Test hundred at Headingley - both Sam Robson (2014) and Adam Lyth (2015) were out of the side by the end of the summer.If Hales' failing had been to linger too long, then a different criticism could be levelled at Moeen Ali.

The idea is Strauss own and he outlined the thinking behind it at Headingley on Wednesday.'Today I'm introducing the Super Series the winner of which will be the overall tour winner for the Sri Lanka and Pakistan series over all formats', 'said the former England captain.'The rationale is that the game of cricket is evolving unbelievably quickly and I think we feel responsibility to ensure the international game develops. Central to that is context and relevance for every game of cricket you play. We believe the Super Series will provide that by connecting the formats and ensuring every game counts for something more than just itself.'Two separate white'ball teams and a red'ball team will be connected by something greater than their own immediate interests. What this doesn't do is replace any of the individual series awards this summer so there will still be a Test series victory plus the one-day series and the Twenty20 match as well. But it sits on top of that wraps around it and creates something bigger to aim for.'The ECB is very keen to be at the fore front of efforts to modernise the international game and we feel this is a good way of ensuring the game remains relevant in both fans and players minds.'If the same points formula had been applied to England's winter tours, the outcome would have been decided in the last match and the Test series winners would have been pipped at the line. Of course we would love the final game to be a Super Series decider that would be perfect,' said Strauss.'If you look at the last two series we played ' against South Africa we would have lost the Super Series in the final Twenty20 and against Pakistan in the UAE we would have won the Super Series in the super over in the final Twenty20. Anyone out there who doesn't see the need for international cricket to keep moving forwards really does have their head stuck in the sand.'I think we have to be on the front foot on this and say look we have a very vibrant Test support in this country and we've seen some fantastic Test matches over the last 12-18 months but there are some worrying signs there,' so let's act before it's too late'.",5/20/16,Sri Lanka Pakistan will face England under a new for,,,1777,"KATHMANDU: A 42-year-old woman born in Nepal climbed Mount Everest for the seventh time on Friday, breaking her own record for the most summits of the world's highest mountain by any woman, a hiking official said.",5/20/16,7 Eleven worker first woman climb Everest seven ti,,,1778,"Some Russian athletes are likely to have tested positive for doping in the 2008 Olympic Games after their samples were re-examined, the Interfax news agency quoted Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko as saying on Friday.Thirty one athletes from six sports could be banned from this year's Rio Olympics after failing doping tests when 454 samples from the 2008 Beijing Games were re-examined, the International Olympic Committee said on Tuesday.""Now they will publish (a report for) 2008.

Manchester's new double act will also have on their radar Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger -- who struggles to hide his disdain for Mourinho -- champions Leicester's Claudio Ranieri and Liverpool's Juergen Klopp, who was Guardiola's main adversary in Germany. Add in new Chelsea manager Antonio Conte, who has been called ""the Italian Jose Mourinho"", and the soap opera possibilities in soccer's village become endless. ' ' What all the central characters share, apart from a clear belief in their own ability, is an elite status which provides a passport to the game's top jobs. Only Frenchman Wenger has chosen to stay put, overseeing Arsenal for almost 20 years and 1,120 games.'The rest are often on the move. England's League Managers' Association has revealed that the average tenure of a Premier League manager is now little more than two seasons, with 11 of last year's 20 starters already kicked out. ' ' Each new manager knows the clock is ticking on his Premier League career, an understanding that contributes to the bear-pit atmosphere that surrounds many games. Old rivalries are intensified and only the strongest survive. ' ' ""The same small group of managers are employed because they are the strongest brands in the market,"" said Michael Calvin, award-winning author of Living on a Volcano, a book about modern-day English football managers. ' ' ""In previous generations it was all player-driven but modern-day players are pretty vanilla and so managers have the perceived personality,"" he added. ""The modern-day manager is actually a middle manager in a global corporation, subject to similar restraints in similar industries. The owners are driven by the share price and a pathological desire to avoid brand damage."" ' ' 'To do that, Guardiola and Mourinho will have to hit the ground running and start winning immediately. German Klopp believes Spaniard Guardiola will know what to expect after his spells at Barcelona and Bayern Munich. 'He will enjoy the league because it is a great league and a real competition and he is a real competitor. That is what he wants,"" Klopp said. ' ' Former Barcelona boss Guardiola certainly brings the pedigree with two Champions League titles among his 12 trophies as a manager. What will be fascinating is to see how former Real Madrid manager Mourinho reacts to his old foe. ' ' In Spain, their old friendship did not survive an often bruising rivalry which Guardiola says he did not have good memories of. ' ' Relations between the Manchester clubs are not as hostile and Mourinho may chose to play things down, rather than stoke them up as he clearly did in Spain.

He turned pro soon after that.Early in his career, he battled societal norms as frequently as he did his opponents. In 1964, as the struggle for civil rights simmered, he knocked out heavy favorite Sonny Liston to win the heavyweight title for the first time, then told reporters that he was a member of the Nation of Islam and had changed his name to Muhammad Ali, a name many news outlets at the time were slow to recognize.By 1967, he had successfully defended the title nine times, all but two by knockout. With the Vietnam War raging, he refused induction into the U.S. Army, on religious grounds, and was arrested and charged with draft evasion. When prodded further for his reasons for resisting, he said, 'I am not going 10,000 miles to help murder, kill, and burn other people to simply help continue the domination of white slave-masters over dark people the world over.'Though he remained free on appeal, he was stripped of his title and not allowed to box for more than three years. The conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court, unanimously, in 1971. (A 2013 film by Stephen Frears, 'Muhammad Ali's Greatest Fight,' which dramatized the court's decision, debuted in Cannes, aired on HBO in the U.S., and earned an Emmy nomination.)During his exile from the ring, Ali decided to try acting, starring in the 1969 Broadway musical 'Buck White' at the George Abbott Theatre. He played a militant black lecturer, and got better reviews than the show, which closed after seven performances. 'He sings with a pleasant slightly impersonal voice, acts without embarrassment and moves with innate dignity,' wrote New York Times reviewer Clive Barnes.Ali's boxing career was defined by his matches against top opponents, particularly rivals Joe Frazier and George Foreman. His 1971 bout with Frazier to unify the heavyweight championship, his third after being reinstated, was called the Fight of the Century. Among those in attendance at Madison Square Garden were Miles Davis, Barbra Streisand, and Sammy Davis Jr. Bert Lancaster was the color commentator for the closed-circuit TV feed. Life Magazine hired Frank Sinatra as the photographer for Norman Mailer's story.Ali had exploded the era of humble sports heroes when he declared, 'I am the greatest!' in the run-up to his title fight with Liston. He also was among the first athletes to trash-talk his opponents, and he called Frazier, who supported the war, an Uncle Tom. Frazier knocked down Ali in the 15th round, and won a unanimous decision.Ali had to wait three years for another shot at the championship, this time against Foreman, who had beaten Frazier so badly in taking the title that few gave the 32-year-old challenger a chance against the 25-year-old champ. Ali called the fight, held in Kinshasa, Zaire, the Rumble in the Jungle. In documenting the bout 22 years later, Gast's Oscar-winning 'When We Were Kings' showed how an ebullient Ali had arrived on the scene a few days before the taciturn Foreman, and won over the nation's citizens. An impromptu entourage of hundreds followed him around chanting, 'Ali, bomaye!' (Ali, kill him!).In 1977, Ali lent his name to a short-lived NBC animated series 'I Am the Greatest!: The Adventures of Muhammad Ali.' Somewhat more memorably that year, he joined Sylvester Stallone ' whose 'Rocky' was to win best picture ' to present the best supporting actress award to Beatrice Straight for her role in 'Network.'In the ring, a third, brutal fight against Frazier (the 'Thrilla in Manilla') as well as battles with Ken Norton subjected Ali to a great deal of punishment. And though he would become the first heavyweight to reclaim the title for a third time in 1978 at age 36, when he beat 25-year-old Leon Spinks in a rematch, the wear and tear of a career in boxing was apparent.He retired, and stayed that way for two years, but ill-advisedly returned for two more bouts, with Larry Holmes and Trevor Burbick, both cringe-inducing losses.In 1996, 12 years after his Parkinson's diagnosis, Ali, showing the effects of the disease, lit the torch to begin the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. In 2005, he was presented with the Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush.Ali is survived by his fourth wife, Yolanda 'Lonnie' Williams, two sons, and seven daughters, including Leila Ali, a boxer who retired, undefeated, in 2007.",6/4/16,Boxing legend Muhammad Ali dies US,,,1877,"Providence, Guyana: Sunil Narine snared career-best figures of six for 27 on his return to West Indies colours as the hosts defeated South Africa by four wickets in the opening match of the Tri-Nation One-Day International series at the Guyana National Stadium on Friday.",6/4/16,Narine sinks Proteas in West Indies r,,,1878,"Los Angeles: Boxing legend Muhammad Ali was fighting for his life in an Arizona hospital on Friday, with a source close to his family describing his condition as ""very grave"" as he battled a respiratory problem.",6/4/16,Boxing legend Alis condition very grav,,,1879,"San Jos', United States: Lionel Messi touched down in California on Friday as Argentina prepared for the possibility that the injured Barcelona superstar may not be fit for next week's Copa America Centenario showdown with Chile.",6/4/16,Messi arrives in California for C,,,1880,Novak Djokovic joined the tennis greats on Sunday when he downed British second seed Andy Murray 3-6 6-1 6-2 6-4 to claim his maiden French Open title and hold all four grand slams at the same time.,6/5/16,Djokovic joins greats with maiden French Open ti,,,1881,"LAHORE: The Pakistan cricket Board (PCB) has announced a 17-member Test squad for the tour of England in July.Chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq revealed the names of the players at a press conference here on Sunday.Misbah-ul-Haq has been retained as captain of the Test team which include three openers, seven middle-order batsmen, five bowlers and two wicketkeepers.Mohammad Hafeez, Yasir Shah and Zulfiqar Babar have been included in the team after they were declared fit while fast bowler Amir Khan's inclusion will be based on the issuance of his visa.However, Inzamam-ul-aq Haq HHh Haq hopes that Amir would get the visa for the tour.Pakistan will play four Test matches against England on the tour.'",6/5/16,PCB announces Test squad for England seri,,,1882,"JAKARTA: Lee Chong Wei edged Denmark's Jan O Jorgensen on Sunday to win his sixth Indonesia Open badminton title, raising hopes the Malaysian ace may be on course for Olympic victory.Second seed Lee battled back from one set down to defeat fifth seed Jorgensen 17-21, 21-19, 21-17 in a thriller that was marked by a series of hard-fought rallies and dramatic smashes.Jorgensen, ranked fifth in the world, dominated in the early stages of the men's singles final and appeared to be heading for victory as he took the lead in the second set.But world number two Lee fought back doggedly, winning a series of long rallies to cling on.By the final stages of the third set, Lee was firmly in control, confidently winning point after point as Jorgensen's initial confidence faded.The victory will be a boost for Lee as he heads to Rio this summer, where the 33-year-old will again try to win Olympic gold.At the last two Olympics, Lee has lost in the final to his arch-rival, China's Lin Dan.In another boost for the Malaysian, Lin was knocked out of the Indonesian Open earlier in the week, losing in a shock defeat to unseeded Indonesian Jonatan Christie.Number one seed Chen Long of China withdrew, blaming an injury.Despite his loss in the final, Jorgensen's impressive performance in the Indonesian Open is likely to be a boost for the Danes, coming hot on the heels of their maiden Thomas Cup victory last month.Thousands of fans flocked to watch the final at the Istora Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta.'",6/5/16,Lee gets Olympic boost with Indonesia wi,,,1883,"ISLAMABAD:Boxer Amir Khan has denied betraying his British upbringing after being criticised for saying he would represent Pakistan at the Rio Games, insisting he only wanted to boost the sport in his parents' country of birth.Stinging lossHunting for championsNo longer the brash youngster who was known for his fast cars and flashy lifestyle and who regularly made headlines for his speeding tickets, Khan now speaks passionately about the need to give back to those less fortunate -- a trait he says he learned from his idol, the late Muhammad Ali.Last year, he travelled to the Greek island of Lesbos to lead a charitable drive for Syrian refugees, while his current trip to Pakistan has seen him raise money and pledge wells for the residents of Thar, a drought-ridden southern district home to some of the country's most destitute people.Ali, he says, was ""not just a champion but a people's champion and that's how I want to be.""His academy in Islamabad -- modelled after the one he founded in Bolton, northwest England, will aim to seek out talent in a country which only boasts sporadic success in cricket.He said: ""I really believe in the country, I really believe in the talent we have here, just like I did in the UK.

England's two biggest doubts concern a pair of players who know Lord's well as it is their Middlesex home ground.Top-order batsman Nick Compton has been struggling for runs, and fast bowler Steven Finn for wickets.With England having again selected a 12-man squad, it looks as if Compton will get another match at number three.Finn's place is under threat from uncapped seamer Jake Ball, although England appear ready to retain the Middlesex quick.With England captain Alastair Cook now having completed the burdensome business of getting to 10,000 Test runs, the left-handed opener could be in the mood to make a major score at Lord's.Meanwhile England new-ball duo James Anderson and Stuart Broad, first and third in the world Test bowler rankings respectively, will look to maintain their standing.Two years ago, Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews scored a fine Test century in a thrilling draw at Lord's where the match went down to the last ball.For this fixture, Sri Lanka may make changes to their side.Stylish wicket-keeper/batsman Kusal Perera -- a late addition to the squad after his drugs ban was overturned by the International Cricket Council because of a faulty lab analysis in Doha -- could end more than six months out by replacing injured all-rounder Milinda Siriwardana (twisted ankle).Fast bowler Shaminda Eranga was reported for a suspect action during the second Test and is understood to have undergone tests at the England and Wales Cricket Board's training centre at Loughborough University this week.Although Eranga is still available to play, Sri Lanka could give a debut to uncapped 29-year-old left-armer Chaminda Bandara in the absence of the injured Dhammika Prasad and Dushmantha Chameera.'",6/8/16,England reach for the whitewash against Sri L,,,1911,"LAHORE: Diana Baig, the talented 20-year-old girl plays for Pakistan's national team in both cricket and football. She represented the country as one of the ""Girls in Green"" at the recent World Twenty20 tournament in India, in between practicing her penalty shoot-out skills.She grew up playing street cricket and football with other children in the magnificent Hunza Valley, their makeshift arenas ringed by some of the world's tallest mountains in northern Gilgit-Baltistan.Baig belongs to the Ismaili sect of Shia Islam, which largely freed her from the restrictions placed on other more conservative women in the Muslim country, where her gender is battling for greater freedom.From the streets, Baig began playing in community events and for local teams, and by 2010 she was leading the newly-formed Gilgit-Baltistan women's team.Two years later, she was selected for Pakistan's A side, and then as a reserve player for the 2013 World Cup. In 2015, she finally won her first international cap, playing for Pakistan against Bangladesh.Her journey to the forefront of Pakistani women's football was even more dramatic.While playing cricket in Islamabad in 2010, Baig tried out for the Gilgit-Baltistan football team on a whim after friends told her they needed players.She made the team and, to her disbelief, in 2014 was selected to play for Pakistan at the SAFF Championships in Bahrain.She has been a member of the starting 11 as a defender ever since, she says, unable to hide her excitement.Baig has had to fight harder for her cricket career.Unlike in men's cricket, Pakistan's women's players are not contracted and are selected on a match by match basis from lower-ranked teams, such as the several hundred playing at the provincial level.That means that there were times when Baig was in -- and times when she was out.Now Baig is fighting to maintain a crucial balance between her sporting dreams and education.""It becomes very hard,"" she says.

Alex Hales was 41 not out, having been dropped on 19 and 39, with nightwatchman Steven Finn, missed on one, unbeaten on six.England, 2-0 up in the three-match series, were rocking at 50 for three before first-innings century-maker Jonny Bairstow helped Hales add 52 for the fourth wicket.However Pradeep had Nick Compton out for 19, caught behind tamely pushing at Shaminda Eranga.Compton had been promoted to open in place of England captain Alastair Cook, after the left-hander suffered a knee injury fielding close in earlier on Saturday.England were now 45 for one and that quickly became 50 for three. Joe Root (four) was bowled by an absolute shooter from Pradeep. New batsman James Vince was out for a golden duck as he deliberately played no shot to a Pradeep delivery that nipped back down the Lord's slope and knocked over his off stump.Bairstow, in at 84 for four in the first innings before making a Test-best 167 not out, survived the hat-trick. But on 32 he too was clean bowled by Pradeep.Pradeep ended the day with three for 25 in nine overs but his figures could easily have been better.Earlier, England all-rounder Chris Woakes started and finished a collapse that saw Sri Lanka, 162 for one overnight, dismissed for 288. That gave England, who made 416 in their first innings, a lead of 128.Woakes, who took a wicket with his first ball Saturday, ended the innings with the opening delivery of a new spell when Eranga was caught in the slips. Warwickshire all-rounder Woakes took three for 31 in 17.1 overs.Sri Lanka resumed Saturday with Kaushal Silva 79 not out and Kusal Mendis 25 not. But they both fell for their overnight scores as Sri Lanka subsided in the face of increasingly accurate fast bowling, with the overcast conditions making batting harder than had been the case on Friday.Woakes had Mendis lbw with his first ball Saturday before Silva was caught behind off Stuart Broad.Kusal Perera (42) and Rangana Herath (31) checked England's progress with a seventh-wicket partnership of 71.Perera's bold innings was particularly impressive as this was his first match in more than six months after a drugs ban was rescinded because of a botched analysis.

He later injured a finger diving for a catch and left the field for treatment.The result leaves Australia with two wins from three matches, while South Africa has one win from three.West Indies have one win from two matches, ahead of their game against Australia in St. Kitts on Monday.Fast bowlers Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood and spinner Adam Zampa took three wickets each for Australia.Hazlewood picked up the prized wicket of South African captain AB de Villiers (39) with a superb delivery that swung late, beat the inside edge and collected middle stump.It proved to be the turning point of the match as de Villiers departed to leave South Africa 210/4, after which it all went awry for the Proteas.'",6/12/16,Warner ton helps Australia beat South Africa by 36 ru,,,1958,Marseille: Eric Dier's superb free-kick was cancelled out by Denis Glushakov's injury-time equaliser as England and Russia drew 1-1 in their Euro 2016 Group B opener on Saturday.,6/12/16,England and Russia draw 1 1 at Euro 2016,,,1959,"Hertogenbosch, Netherlands: Nicolas Mahut warmed up for Wimbledon by winning his third 's-Hertogenbosch title after dominating a rain-delayed final on Monday.After taking the opening set 6-4 against Luxembourg's Gilles Muller on the Dutch grass court on Sunday, Mahut wrapped up victory by claiming the second set by the same scoreline.It was his third title win in 's-Hertogenbosch, the 34-year-old eighth-seeded wild card having previously won the Dutch event in 2013 and 2015.

But Australian umpire Rod Tucker had already called a no-ball. Replays suggested Pradeep's front foot may have been behind the crease but fielding teams are unable to challenge a no-ball call by an umpire and Hales survived.In February, a similar incident saw Australia's Adam Voges make 239 in a Test against New Zealand in Wellington after being reprieved on seven following an incorrectly called no-ball by English umpire Richard Illingworth.Under International Cricket Council regulations, the third umpire is powerless to intervene in such situations.There are proposals on the table to prevent a repeat of these types of incidents and Ford said: ""The ICC have to look at it.""It seems strange with the technology available that you can still get a line call wrong,"" the South African added.""The best solution is for the umpires to worry about what's happening down the other end and let technology look after the line call.

""We're ready for them. We scored a lot of runs against Australia's attack here last year -- I think it's going to be a brilliant series.""While Test specialist Cook prepares for Pakistan, wicket-keeper Jonny Bairstow will be looking to take his red-ball form into the intervening five one-day internationals against Sri Lanka.Bairstow's recall into England's one-day squad was announced just as he was being confirmed as both man-of-the-match at Lord's and the hosts' overall man of the Test series too.His 167 not out in the first innings at Lord's was his Test-best score and came amidst a series scoring-spree that saw Bairstow total 387 runs at an average of 129, with the Yorkshireman also holding 19 catches behind the stumps.Together with James Anderson, who took 21 wickets at a stunningly low average of 10.80, Bairstow was the central figure of the series.Bairstow repeatedly helped England recover from top-order collapses against Sri Lanka and Cook likened his contribution to that of retired former England wicket-keeper Matt Prior.Prior's wicket-keeping came under intense scrutiny early in his career, especially as England -- be it Alan Knott, Bob Taylor or Jack Russell -- have long prided themselves on their glovemen.Bairstow, himself the son of the late former Yorkshire and England wicket-keeper David Bairstow, also found his work in the field being called into question after he floored a couple of seemingly straightforward chances against Sri Lanka.Bairstow, meanwhile, was pleased at maintaining the form he showed in South Africa, where his 150 not out in Cape Town in January gave him a maiden Test century.For Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews, the hope is his side, having had time to adjust to English conditions, will raise their game in the white-ball formats. However, the all-rounder accepted England were a much improved one-day team from the side that Sri Lanka thrashed by nine wickets at last year's World Cup in Wellington.'",6/14/16,Cook ready for Pakistan after Sri Lanka su,,,1978,"LONDON: England included the uncapped trio of batsman Dawid Malan and bowlers Tymal Mills and Liam Dawson in a 13-man squad for their upcoming Twenty20 international against Sri Lanka.Malan, born in London but brought up in South Africa, gets his chance after impressing for England's second-string Lions team.Fast bowler Mills now only plays limited overs cricket because of a back condition, while Hampshire left-arm spinner Dawson is also a useful batsman.England will be looking to build on the form that saw them finish runners-up to the West Indies in this year's World Twenty20 in India.None of the uncapped trio, however, were included in England's 14-man squad for the five one-days internationals against Sri Lanka that will take place before the lone Twenty20 international.But Jonny Bairstow, fresh from being named man-of-the-match in the drawn third Test against Sri Lanka, was back in the one-day squad.Bairstow, also England's man of the series in a 2-0 campaign win over Sri Lanka, was one of three glovemen in the one-day squad along with regular white-ball keeper Jos Buttler and Kent's Sam Billings.Middlesex batsman Eoin Morgan retained the captaincy of both the ODI and T20 squads, with Test skipper Alastair Cook not having played limited overs cricket for England since before last year's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.Meanwhile Test new-ball duo James Anderson and Stuart Broad were again spared white-ball duty ahead of England's four-match series in the five-day format at home to Pakistan starting next month.England ODI squad: Eoin Morgan (Middlesex, capt), Moeen Ali (Worcestershire), Jonny Bairstow (Yorkshire, wkt), Jos Buttler (Lancashire, wkt), Steven Finn (Middlesex), Chris Jordan (Sussex), Alex Hales Hales (Nottinghamshire), Liam Plunkett (Yorkshire), Adil Rashid (Yorkshire), Joe Root (Yorkshire), Jason Roy (Surrey), James Vince (Hampshire), David Willey (Yorkshire), Chris Woakes (Warwickshire)   England T20 squad: Eoin Morgan (Middlesex, captain), Jonny Bairstow (Yorkshire, wkt), Sam Billings (Kent, wkt), Jos Buttler (Lancashire, wkt), Liam Dawson (Hampshire), Chris Jordan (Sussex), Dawid Malan (Middlesex), Tymal Mills (Sussex), Liam Plunkett (Yorkshire), Adil Rashid (Yorkshire), Jason Roy (Surrey), James Vince (Hampshire), David Willey (Yorkshire)Fixtures Jun 21: 1st ODI, Trent Bridge, Jun 24: 2nd ODI, Edgbaston, Jun 26: 3rd ODI, Bristol, Jun 29: 4th ODI, The Oval, Jul 02: 5th ODI, Cardiff, Jul 05: T20I, Southampton'",6/14/16,England call up uncapped trio for Sri Lanka T20,,,1979,Ireland can take encouragement from a 1-1 draw in their Euro 2016 Group E opener on Monday but the result was a cause of great concern for Sweden whose mediocrity contrasted starkly with their opponents' desire.MATCH-WINNING CHANCE,6/14/16,Ireland can build on draw after Sweden disappoi,,,1980,"Basseterre, Saint Kitts and Nevis: Marlon Samuels produced his best batting effort in One-Day International cricket against Australia to lead the West Indies to a six-wicket victory in the fifth match of the Tri-Nation series at Warner Park in St Kitts on Monday.Set a challenging target after Usman Khawaja's 98 and supporting half-centuries from skipper Steve Smith (74) and George Bailey (55) lifted the visitors to 265 for seven batting first, the enigmatic Samuels stroked 92 to ensure that the target was reached with 20 deliveries to spare.The Jamaican right-hander made an important deposit on a significant overdraft against the World Cup-holders, his innings spanning 87 deliveries and decorated with eight fours and four sixes -- the last three of which came off consecutive balls from leg-spinner Adam Zampa over long-off.In keeping with his mercurial nature, he was run out off the very next delivery to have the West Indies at 240 for four in the 41st over. Two more wickets fell to Nathan Coulter-Nile with the score at 254 before Kieron Pollard and Carlos Brathwaite formalised victory in the 46th over.Denesh Ramdin also played a key role in the run-chase. He supported Samuels in a 73-run fourth-wicket stand and continued to play sensibly following the demise of his senior partner before being bowled by Coulter-Nile for 29.Victory pulled the West Indies within a point of leaders Australia in the three-team standings. West Indies next play South Africa on Wednesday at the same venue.Samuels had joined Darren Bravo at the crease following a rollicking opening stand of 74 in ten overs before all-rounder James Faulker removed Fletcher for 27 while Zampa trapped Charles in front for 48.Bravo and Samuels then steadied the West Indies chase, keeping them well on course in an 82-run third-wicket partnership that was broken when Zampa removed Bravo for 39 via at bat-pad catch that lobbed comfortably to wicketkeeper Matthew Wade.Earlier, Khawaja's promotion to open the batting in the absence of the injured David Warner paid immediate dividends.He lost Aaron Finch in the very first over to West Indies captain Jason Holder but then featured in a 170-run second-wicket partnership with Smith, who overcame the nagging discomfort of a right leg injury to help put his team in a commanding position by the time he departed in the 35th over, the victim of a clever change of pace from all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite.Khawaja was on the verge of a maiden ODI hundred but, becalmed in the nineties, he took on the challenge of a third run for his third-wicket partner, Bailey, and was found short of his ground by Jerome Taylor's return from the boundary to stand-in wicketkeeper Fletcher. His innings occupied 123 deliveries and was embellished by three sixes and four fours.Fletcher's position behind the stumps was the result of an injury to Ramdin who fell heavily on his right shoulder when attempting to effect a run out a few overs earlier. He returned for the final overs, taking two catches to dismiss Travis Head and Bailey off Pollard.Head earned his selection after Warner was ruled out of the rest of the tournament with a broken finger sustained against South Africa on Saturday.

Karunaratne was 19 not out and Silva unbeaten on 12.Monday's first over saw Silva edge Broad just short of England captain Alastair Cook at first slip. But Anderson, England's all-time leading Test-wicket taker, struck when Silva, padding up after failing to pick an inswinger going against the Lord's slipe, was lbw for 16.Silva reviewed but to no avail, with Sri Lanka 45 for one. No sooner had Silva been dismissed than the umpires took the players off the field after just 18 minutes' play. But the weather relented for play to resume after tea. Even though the floodlights were on, there was now a risk the match might be halted for bad light.Bairstow's Test-best 167 not out and 85 from Cook were the major contributions to England's first innings 416. Sri Lanka could only manage 288 in reply, despite fifties from Karunaratne and Silva.England's second innings 233 for seven declared saw Alex Hales again fall short of a maiden Test century with 94 -- his third fifty of a series where the opener had twice been dismissed in the 80s.Sri Lanka continue their tour with two one-day internationals against Ireland in Dublin on Thursday and Saturday. They then face England in the first at Nottingham's Trent Bridge in the first of five one-dayers on June 21.Monday's draw meant England lead the inaugural Super Series against Sri Lanka by 10 points to two.

highly-fancied Austria 2-0 in their Group F opener in Bordeaux on Tuesday (Jun 14).Austria, tipped as tournament dark horses, dominated the opening period but Szalai fired Hungary ahead on 62 minutes with Stieber wrapping up a shock victory over their old rivals late on in the 138th meeting between the sides.Aleksandar Dragovic was sent off for Austria shortly after Szalai ended an 18-month goal drought as Hungary made a triumphant return to a major tournament having last featured at the 1986 World Cup.Hungary goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly kept a clean sheet as he became the first 40-year-old to feature at the European Championship, surpassing Germany's Lothar Matthaus as the oldest player in tournament history.Austria captain Christian Fuchs and winger Martin Harnik were the only two survivors from the country's debut campaign eight years ago named in Marcel Koller's starting line-up.However, they were inches away from the perfect start when Bayern Munich star David Alaba went agonisingly close to justifying his billing as one of the potential stars of the tournament when his dipping left-footed strike from outside the area crashed against the post.The versatile Alaba, operating in his customary central midfield with Austria, soon fired another warning to Hungary with a first-time strike at Kiraly after a threaded pass through from Marko Arnautovic.Szalai miscued a header from a Balazs Dzsudzsak free-kick in a rare opening for Hungary, while Kiraly showed his reflexes remain sharp despite his advancing years to claw behind a low strike from Zlatko Junuzovic.Arnautovic then slid a dangerous low ball across the face of goal as Austria continued to threaten, but Harnik lost his footing as he tried to slide home at the far post.Hungary captain Dzsudzsak wasted arguably the best chance of the opening 45 minutes, though, as he screwed his shot wide of goal after he was picked out by Laszlo Kleinheisler on the right-hand side of the penalty area.Dzsudzsak again took aim 10 minutes into the second period, his stinging 30-yard shot forcing Austria keeper Robert Almer to fist the punch behind for a corner.And Hungary grabbed a surprise lead just beyond the hour when Kleinheisler slipped in Szalai, who was played onside by Fuchs, with the powerful striker poking the ball underneath Almer for his first goal at any level since December 2014.Austria appeared to have levelled when Martin Hinteregger rifled in from the edge of the area, but referee Clement Turpin disallowed the goal for a foul on Tamas Kadar with Dragovic dismissed for a second booking.And Stieber triggered delirious celebrations when he raced from just inside the Austria half to beat Almer three minutes from time with a sublime chip as Hungary completed a stunning upset for their first European Championship win since 1964.''",6/15/16,Hungary earn shock 2 0 win over 10 man Austri,,,1989,"SEATTLE: Argentina maintained their 100 percent record at the Copa America

in Foxborough on Saturday.The two-time world champions are determined to end a 23-year wait for a major title after suffering agonizing defeats in the finals of the 2014 World Cup and last year's Copa America.On current form few would bet against the South American giants, who could afford to omit Lionel Messi from their starting line-up following his hat-trick display against Panama.The match was effectively settled within the first quarter of an hour, with Tottenham Hotspur winger Erik Lamela opening the scoring with a deflected free-kick in the 13th minute.Two minutes later China-based forward Ezequiel Lavezzi marked his comeback from injury with a goal, volleying home from close range after Gonzalo Higuain's downward header.Central defender Victor Cuesta made it 3-0 just after the half-hour, diverting home Lavezzi's low cross in the 32nd minute.Argentina manager Gerardo Martino brought on Messi at half-time, and a one-sided second half soon became a question of when or if the Barcelona superstar could grab a 54th international goal to equal Gabriel Batistuta's longstanding scoring record.However despite Argentina's dominance, Messi was unable to add to his team's tally,

But this year, Ramazan coincides with the Euros which are another massive draw.Cafes in the Egyptian capital have draped the flags of competing countries over their entrances to attract fans. Some games are played during the day, when devout Muslims are fasting, while others clash with the iftar meal which breaks the daily fast at sunset.In Tunisia, where most cafes are closed during daylight hours in Ramazan, the venue moves to people's homes.

It was a pretty convincing victory today, but we need to be at our best to beat England,"" said Mathews.Eoin Morgan's England have improved dramatically in 50-over cricket since the Sri Lankans thrashed them by nine wickets in Wellington during last year's World Cup.Seekkugge Prasanna came in a three to pinch-hit in explosive style, bludgeoning nine sixes and five fours to leave his previous best ODI score of 42 far behind with 95 from just 46 balls.The fifth and sixth overs of the Ireland reply were maidens and when captain William Porterfield was out to the first ball of the seventh over, Ireland, who have never beaten Sri Lanka in five attempts, could not cope. It needed a last wicket stand of 54 between Andrew McBrine and former England international Boyd Rankin to get the Ireland total over 200.The man of the series was Sri Lanka's Dasun Shanaka, who scored 42 off 19 balls and took five wickets on his debut in the tourists' 76-run win in the first match on Thursday and Mathews has high hopes for the 24-year-old.Perera took advantage of the very good pitch to score 135, his second ODI century, before he was the second of three dismissals in the space of five balls.  He faced 128 balls, with 16 fours and two sixes, and was happy to play second fiddle to Prasanna, who dominated an electrifying second-wicket stand of 161 in 89 balls.The late flurry of wickets allowed Ireland to restrict Sri Lanka to 67 from the last eight overs, when a total of 400 had looked likely.Suranga Lakmal was Sri Lanka's most successful bowler. Sharing the new ball with Mathews, he dismissed both Ireland openers in the space of 10 balls, broke the stubborn seventh wicket stand between Stuart Poynter (36) and McBrine (79 off 64 balls) and added a fourth wicket at a personal cost of just 38 runs.Prasanna completed a fine all-round game with two for 32 from eight overs, and although Shanaka took only one wicket in his second game, it was the big one of the dangerous Kevin O'Brien.",6/19/16,Mathews tells Sri Lanka to up their game against England,,,2029,"Santa Clara, United States: Eduardo Vargas scored four goals as holders Chile sent Mexico spinning to a historic 7-0 defeat to reach the semi-finals of the Copa America Centenario here Saturday.Hoffenheim forward Vargas completed a hat-trick in 13 devastating minutes either side of half-time to send Chile into a semi-final against Colombia in Chicago on Wednesday.The drubbing was Mexico's worst ever defeat in the finals of a major tournament. Their previous biggest loss was a 6-0 rout by West Germany at the 1978 World Cup in Argentina.The rout was also only one goal away from equalling Mexico's heaviest ever defeat in any international, an 8-0 thrashing by England in London in 1961.Vargas grabbed his fourth goal in the 74th minute to give Chile a 6-0 lead. But the punishment did not finish there with Edson Puch adding a seventh in the 88th minute for his second of the match.Chile, winners of last year's Copa America on home soil, had faced an intimidating atmosphere in front of a crowd of 70,547 people at the Levi's Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers.But despite the overwhelmingly pro-Mexico crowd, Chile were quicker to settle, with Puch opening the scoring on 16 minutes when he steered in a rebound from Marcelo Diaz's shot after Guillermo Ochoa could only parry away.Vargas grabbed a second a minute before half-time to stun the crowd into silence as the teams headed in for the break.Chile then cut loose early in the second half with slick inter-play ripping apart a feeble Mexican defense at will.Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez made it 3-0 in the 49th minute before two more goals from Vargas in the 52nd and 57th minutes piled on the agony for Mexico.Several Mexican players visibly wilted in the face of the onslaught, and for periods the game resembled a training exercise for Chile as they swept forward relentlessly. Vargas's fourth made it 6-0 on the night before Puch then toe-poked home to complete the scoring.Brazilian referee Heber Lopes spared Mexico the possibility of greater humiliation, whistling for full-time almost on the stroke of 90 minutes, with no time added on.",6/19/16,Vargas scores four as Chile thrash Mexico 7 0,,,2030,"Foxborough, United States: Lionel Messi scored a record-equalling 54th international goal as Argentina outclassed Venezuela 4-1 to book their place in the semi-finals of the Copa America Centenario here Saturday.The Barcelona superstar scored his fourth goal of the tournament in the 60th minute at the Gillette Stadium to equal Gabriel Batistuta's long-time Argentina international goalscoring record.Messi also created a goal for Gonzalo Higuain, who scored twice, and second half substitute Erik Lamela as Argentina set up a semi-final against the United States in Houston on Tuesday.Messi is determined to lead Argentina to their first trophy in 23 years after a series of agonizing near-misses which include defeats in the finals of last year's Copa America and the 2014 World Cup final.Messi's genius created the opening goal after eight minutes, with the playmaker lofting a sublime curling pass to pick out Higuain's run into the area.Napoli forward Higuain still had plenty to do but skillfully directed a first time strike past Venezuela goalkeeper Dani Hernandez for a wonderful goal.Argentina remained firmly in control but were jolted in the 27th minute when Nicolas Gaitan picked up a needless yellow card for a kick on Alexander Gonzalez that will see him suspended for the semi-final.Argentina's dominance clearly had Venezuela rattled, and the Vinotinto's defensive unease led to the next goal.A slack backpass from Arquimedes Figuera went straight to Higuain in space, and the striker coolly rounded Hernandez to stroke home his second of the night to make it 2-0 after 29 minutes.But just when it looked as if the floodgates would open, Venezuela rallied impressively and had Argentina rocking with a series of chances.  West Bromwich Albion striker Salomon Rondon forced a save from Sergio Romero and hit the woodwork in quick succession.Romero was left scrambling to save once again just before half-time, when fullback Rolf Feltscher's long-range shot deflected off Gabriel Mercado and looped up and over the Argentina keeper.Venezuela looked to have a justifiable claim for a penalty when Higuain brought down Josef Martinez in the box but Mexican referee Roberto Garcia was unmoved.  Seconds later though Garcia was pointing to the spot after Romero clumsily bundled over Martinez for a clear penalty.But Venezuela's pressure went unrewarded when Luis Manuel Seijas tried a risky ""Panenka"" down the middle which Romero read and gathered with ease.Venezuela were unable to renew their period of pressure in the second half, and Messi effectively put the contest to bed with his record-equalling goal in the 60th minute, which came after Argentina pressed high to force a turnover.Gaitan won the tackle and passed to Messi, who quickly played a one-two with the Benfica winger before poking his finish between Hernandez's legs.Rondon pulled a goal back with a header in the 70th minute, but Messi's response was instant, threading a pass to Lamela whose shot crept in at Hernandez's near post.",6/19/16,Messi record as Argentina thrash Venezu,,,2031,"Oakmont, United States: Shane Lowry is determined to enjoy his moment in the spotlight as he leads the US Open going into Sunday's final day.The burly, bearded Irishman showed superb form on Saturday to climb his way past some of the best golfers in the world and take a two shot lead with four holes to go in his third round when darkness intervened.Now he will have to get up at the crack of dawn on Sunday and finish those holes off before regrouping for the final 18.It is something the 29-year-old from County Offaly, the son of 1982 All-Ireland winning footballer Brendan Lowry, says he is looking forward to.""I've been beating myself up over the last six months trying to get in this position,"" he said. ""I'm here now.

Nat Sciver then joined Knight, hitting 27 of the 37 more required at the fall of Beaumont's wicket but contriving to allow Knight to complete her half-century before securing the winning single off Iqbal.There was a nervous moment at the start of England's chase when opener Lauren Winfield was caught at slip off the first ball but though Pakistan's captain, the offspinner Sana Mir, bowled Georgia Elwiss for 12, at 53 for 2 from 10 overs England were already on target for a comfortable win.Pakistan's 165 all out was built around opener Sidra Ameen's 52 but none of her team-mates could offer much in the way of support with the bat.It was a day to remember, too, for strike bowler Katherine Brunt, who became only the fourth England player to take 100 ODI wickets.Pakistan's score was their highest in five one-day internationals against England but would have been regarded as disappointing given the platform provided by opener Sidra's maiden ODI half-century.The 24-year-old right-hander from Lahore had made more than half her side's runs off the bat when she was fifth out at 106 in the 32nd over but support was lacking from Pakistan's top and middle order and had it not been for a late show of aggression from Sidra Nawaz and Iqbal then England's task would have been even more straightforward.Asked for bat first on a surface that was predictably sluggish after the wet weather that forced this match to be played in its entirety on the designated reserve day, Pakistan struggled to build early momentum.They crawled to 29 for 1 after 10 overs, the wicket that fell being the one that mattered in particular to Brunt, when Javeria Wadood, tempted by some width, edged the first ball of her fourth over and Amy Jones, keeping wicket for England for the first time in almost two-and-a-half years, held the catch.The result means England move into the top four places in the ICC Women's Championship. If they can maintain that position with eight matches to play they will qualify automatically for the 2017 Women's World Cup, of which they are hosts.England have now won all five of their ODIs against Pakistan and will look to go 2-0 up in three-match series when the teams meet again at Worcester on Wednesday.",6/22/16,Pak women give up first ODI after Knight shines on debut as

to reach the last 16.The Czechs, however, will definitely go home, having finished bottom of the group with one point from three matches.The Turks opened the scoring in the 10th minute when Arda Turan sent Emre Mor scampering away down the right before he crossed for Burak Yilmaz, who ghosted in to send a simple first-time shot from close range flying past Petr Cech.The Czechs almost levelled soon afterwards when Borek Dockal headed against the foot of the post and Tomas Necid could not reach the rebound, before the latter awkwardly volleyed another good chance over 10 minutes later.Although Turkey looked a lot more resilient than they had in their opening two games, they were on the back foot for much of the first half and the Czechs had plenty of chances to score.Full back Pavel Kaderabek missed two great opportunities, firing a shot that Turkey keeper Volkan Babacan saved with his foot before the defender blazed wide following a slick attack down the right.Babacan also pushed a stinging shot from Jaroslav Plasil wide as the Czechs started to find some space on the flanks.Turkey came out all guns blazing in the second half and Emre Mor could have put them two up as he picked up a long ball and drifted in from the right before clipping a shot just over.Yet seconds later Babacan had to make another smart save at the other end from Vladimir Darida.Moments after Turkey were raging at an offside call that went against them, Ozan Tufan sent thousands of Turkish fans into ecstasy as Mehmet Topal teed him up to smash an unstoppable shot into the topcorner from a tight angle.The goal was greeted by a half-dozen flares lighting up the Turkish end of the ground, with some being thrown onto the pitch during the ear-splitting celebrations.Their spirits lifted by

It is the fifth time Sri Lanka have been defeated by ten wickets in an ODI.Their stand was not only a record for England's opening pair - overhauling Vikram Solanki and Marcus Tresocthick's 200 partnership against South Africa in 2003 - but the highest for any wicket in ODIs by England batsmen. Previously, Andrew Strauss and Jonathan Trott - who put on 250 together against Bangladesh here in 2010 - held the record.England lead the five-match series 1-0 after the first match in Nottingham was tied.Sri Lanka opted to bat after winning the toss but their total always looked inadequate on a good batting pitch at Edgbaston as England took wickets at regular intervals.Dinesh Chandimal and Angelo Mathews shared a fourth-wicket stand of 82 to give their side a platform.Mathews fell for 44, however, and Chandimal was run out for 52 by Roy who had earlier produced a brilliant piece of fielding to run out Kusal Perera.Upul Tharanga struck an unbeaten 53 to give Sri Lanka hope but England's bowlers maintained a tight grip throughout, leg-spinner Adil Rasheed the pick of the attack with figures of 2-34 from 10 overs.Hales and man-of-the-match Roy were completely in command against a toothless Sri Lanka attack.Hales smashed six sixes and 10 fours while Roy went to his second one-day international century with his fourth six before driving Seekkuge Prasanna to the cover boundary to seal victory.The third match of the series is in Bristol on Sunday.'",6/25/16,Hales and Roy power England to record breaking ten wicket wi,,,2077,"BRIDGETOWN,' Barbados: Darren Bravo's third hundred and impressive fast bowling from Shannon Gabriel propelled the West Indies to a comprehensive 100-run victory over South Africa in the ninth and final preliminary match of the Tri-Nation One-Day International Series at Kensington Oval in Barbados on Friday.Bravo's stroke-filled 102 anchored an impressive recovery from 21 for four to lift the West Indies to 285 all out off 49.5 overs batting first.Gabriel, in just his second ODI, then tore through the Proteas' vaunted top-order, taking the wickets of Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis and captain A.B. de Villiers in the space of four fearsome overs.It was a setback from which they never recovered, eventually being dismissed for 186 off 46 overs despite a last-wicket partnership of 51 between Morne Morkel and Imran Tahir. Sunil Narine ensured there would be no escape for the South Africans after Gabriel's early blast, the spinner taking three for 28 off ten overs.With their second win in three matches against the Proteas in the tournament, the hosts advance to face World Cup-holders Australia in the final on Sunday at the same venue. It is also the first time in ten years that South Africa have failed to reach the final of a tri-nation ODI series.Of concern for the West Indies looking ahead to the final though will be the fitness of Gabriel, who left the field nursing a right leg injury after claiming the impressive figures of three for 17 from five overs of extreme pace. He should have also snared the wicket of Hashim Amla but wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin missed the straightforward opportunity offered by the prolific opener.West Indies were themselves rocked back at 21 for four when pacer Kagiso Rabada led the assault after de Villiers chose to field. However Bravo's third one-day century, embellished with 12 fours and four sixes off 103 deliveries, proved invaluable. He found an able partner in Kieron Pollard, who curbed his usual all-out aggression in compiling 62 off 71 balls.Their fifth-wicket stand of 156 was a new West Indian record for the wicket against South Africa and wrested the initiative from the visitors who did not help their cause with characteristically untidy cricket in the field, fast-medium bowler Morne Morkel delivering six of the 17 wides conceded by the Proteas.Morkel's nine overs cost 68 runs yet for all that indiscipline, he should have still claimed the important wicket early on of Bravo who, on 11, top-edged an attempted hook only for Wayne Parnell to misjudge the catch at fine-leg and parry the ball over the boundary rope.Imran Tahir, who routed the West Indies in their last meeting in St Kitts with record-breaking figures of seven for 45, was kept wicketless through his ten overs for the first time in ODI cricket against these opponents.South Africa's bowling star without doubt was Rabada, whose returns of three for 31 were highlighted by a devastating opening burst after Parnell had removed Andre Fletcher in his opening over.Generating tremendous pace, Rabada induced an edge from the other opener, Johnson Charles, for Chris Morris to take a comfortable catch at second slip. He then uprooted Marlon Samuels' off-stump first ball to have the West Indies tottering at 12 for three.Ramdin avoided the hat-trick but subsequently succumbed to the lethal hostility of the 21-year-old fast bowler, first ducking into a short ball to take a blow on the back of the helmet before being comprehensively bowled off the next delivery.Bravo and Pollard then countered the rampant South Africans with determination and forceful strokeplay before the big-hitting all-rounder was caught at long-on off the suffering Morkel.Morris claimed three wickets at the end of the innings with West Indies captain Jason Holder (40) and Carlos Brathwaite (33 not out) pushing the home side to a challenging final total.",6/25/16,West Indies topple South Africa in Tri nation seri,,,2078,Bridgetown:Darren Bravo's third hundred and a big fifth-wicket partnership with Kieron Pollard rescued the West Indies from complete ruin to a competitive 285 all out against South Africa in the final preliminary match of the tri-nation series at Kensington Oval on Friday.,6/25/16,Ton up Bravo Pollard rescue Windi,,,2079,LONDON: On court Novak Djokovic is taking tennis to extraordinary new levels with his single-minded obsession with winning; off it the Serbian is more than happy to share power.,6/26/16,Djokovic focused on Wimbledon defence but sees bigger pictur,,,2080,LYON: Hosts France came from behind to beat 10-man Ireland 2-1 and reach the Euro 2016 quarter-finals after two second-half strikes from forward Antoine Griezmann at Parc OL on Sunday.SURGING RUN,6/26/16,Griezmann double sends France into Euro 2016 last eig,,,2081,"BRISTOL, United Kingdom: England captain Eoin Morgan won the toss and elected to field against Sri Lanka in the third one-day international at Bristol on Sunday.England made one change from the side that won Friday's second ODI at Edgbaston by 10 wickets, with pace bowling all-rounder Chris Jordan replacing off-spinner Moeen Ali.That left in-form leg-spinner Adil Rashid as the only specialist slow bowler in England's XI.This was Jordan's first match at this level since he featured against South Africa at Centurion in February.Sri Lanka recalled seam-bowling all-rounder Dasun Shanaka in place of off-spinning all-rounder Suraj Randiv.Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews, struggling with a hamstring problem, was passed fit to play.Dinesh Chandimal, who suffered a hamstring injury while batting at Edgbaston, was included.But it was uncertain at the toss whether he would also keep wicket, with fellow gloveman Kusal Perera, a top-order batsman, having deputised behind the stumps on Friday.England lead the five-match series 1-0 after Tuesday's first ODI at Trent Bridge was tied.Teams England: Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (captain), Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler (wkt), Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan, David Willey, Adil Rashid, Liam PlunkettSri Lanka: Kusal Perera, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Upul Tharanga, Dinesh Chandimal (wkt, Angelo Mathews (captain), Dasun Shanaka, Farveez Maharoof, Seekkuge Prasanna, Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal  Umpires: Paul Reiffel (AUS), Tim Robinson (ENG), TV umpire: Bruce Oxenford (ENG) Match referee: David Boon (AUS)",6/26/16,England bowl against Sri Lanka in 3rd ODI,,,2082,"NEW YORK: Keith Thurman put his stamp on the deeply talented welterweight division Saturday, beating challenger Shawn Porter by a unanimous decision to retain his World Boxing Association title.Thurman kept his undefeated record alive and showed he deserves to be regarded as the kingpin of the welterweight division, which is moving on from the retirements of Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao.The 27-year-old Thurman landed several solid lefts that either wobbled or staggered Porter as he won the close contest at the Barclays Center arena in New York by scores of 115-113 on all three judges scorecards. ""Defense, defense, defense,"" said Thurman who improved to 27-0 with 22 knockouts.The clash between two Americans was supposed to be held earlier this year, but Thurman was involved in a car crash on a rain-slicked Florida street which pushed the bout back three months.Thurman, who has been on fringes of boxing celebrity, is hoping this is a breakthrough moment for him as the former champion Porter proved to be the biggest test of his career to date.Former IBF welterweight champ Porter lost the first 12-round fight of his career.Porter figured he had done enough to wrestle the title away and some in the crowd agreed with him, booing the scores when they were announced  ""I thought I won the fight. But I am satisfied because the competitor came out. We need that rematch,"" Porter said.Thurman said after the slugfest he is willing to give Porter another chance. ""He's a great warrior,"" Thurman said. ""But I knew defense would be key. ""I was able to rock him at least once each round with clear effective blows and I believe that was the key to victory.""Thurman did most of his damage with his left while Porter had his jab working effectively.Thurman buckled Porter's knees with a left hook in the fourth round and landed another left on the button in the 10th when Porter walked into a punch. Thurman suffered a cut over his left eye in the ninth, the first time he has been cut in his career.Porter landed more jabs (59-32), but Thurman threw more power punches (203-177).",6/26/16,Thurman

rallied desperately to get back into the game but ultimately were frustrated by some superb goalkeeping from David Ospina.It was the second time the US had been beaten by Colombia in this tournament.The Colombians also defeated them 2-0 in the tournament's opening match.Colombia had gone closest to scoring first, Real Madrid star James Rodriguez being denied by a fine Tim Howard save

arguably the best US player of the tournament, had another good game but was unable to add to his Copa tally of three goals and three assists.Dempsey almost laid on a goal for Hamburg's Bobby Wood,

in a Sri Lanka score of 248 for 9, but gloom ultimately defined the day, after rain washed out play four overs into the reply. The back end of Sri Lanka's innings had been played in drizzle, which persisted through the lunch break and for some time afterwards. Although the weather relented to allow the teams to resume play, it returned at about 4pm and play was called off by 5.30pm. England had lost Alex Hales, for a golden duck, and were 16 for 1.In Bristol, just like in the first two games, partnerships were severed by canny quicks whenever the visitors threatened to assume control of the match. In the ten overs following the 35th, Sri Lanka lost four wickets for 40 runs, and squandered the base their half-centurions had provided.Liam Plunkett and Chris Woakes claimed three scalps apiece, the former more effective with the new ball, the latter quite good with the old.Mendis batted as he has through the tour. He bludgeoned two Chris Jordan short balls for four and six at the end of the 18th over. Next over, Mendis completed a second ODI fifty with the 78th run of the innings, but then his panache forged his downfall. Attempting to repeat his pulled six against a taller, faster Plunkett, Mendis managed only to put the ball in the palms of deep square leg.Chandimal assumed a more positive outlook as he and Mathews manoeuvred Sri Lanka away from 88 for 3. Mathews ventured a low, straight six off Plunkett in the 26th over, but Adil Rashid's legspin was the more frequent victim of the pair's belligerence. The seamers returned the pair to a more measured approach, though they did continue to score smartly enough, relative to the situation: their 80-run stand was the heftiest in Sri Lanka's innings, and came off 87 balls.Having set themselves up at a reasonable 165 for 3 after 35 overs, the following ten overs were a period of significant decline. Chandimal, then Seekkuge Prasanna, were out in consecutive overs, both caught aiming swipes across the line. Mathews moved to his second half-century in three games in the company of Upul Tharanga, but top-edged a leg-side heave off Jordan to depart for 56 off 67 in the 44th over. Though the match situation was well-poised for Dasun Shanaka to showcase his hitting range, yet he attempted a non-existent single to short third man, and found himself run out cheaply again, by a sharp Joe Root.Tharanga then made the best of having to bat with the tail. He cobbled together a 33-ball 40, while Woakes in particular bowled expertly to his field, at the death. He took out the top of Tharanga's middle stump with his final ball, before Sri Lanka's last-wicket pair swung optimistically through the final over.'",6/27/16,England restrict subdued Sri Lanka before washou,,,2094,"BRIDGETOWN, Barbados: A match-winning three-wicket bowling stint by Mitchell Marsh lifted Australia to a convincing victory by 58 runs against West Indies in the final of the triangular one-day international (ODI) series in Barbados on Sunday.Australia, who batted first after winning the toss, seemed destined to post a middling target until wicketkeeper Matthew Wade, batting at number seven, rattled off an unbeaten 57 off 52 balls.He finished his stint at the crease in style with a towering six over mid wicket off the final ball as the visitors scored 270 for nine from their allotted 50 overs.The Windies made a breezy start in reply as openers Johnson Charles and Andre Fletcher put on a quick 49, with Charles scoring the lion's share of the runs at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown.But the floodgates opened after Fletcher (9) was caught at slip off paceman Josh Hazlewood, as medium-pacer Marsh collected three quick wickets to turn the match decisively and inexorably in Australia's direction.Marsh dismissed Darren Bravo (6) and Marlon Samuels (6) cheaply, before trapping Charles (45) plum leg-before-wicket to leave the Windies staggering at 72 for four.Marsh finished with 3-32 off 10 miserly overs, while Hazlewood (5-50) mopped up the tail as the home team were all out for 212 after 48.4 overs.The result cements Australia's number one ODI ranking, while eighth-ranked West Indies might take some consolation from reaching the final ahead of South Africa, the other team in the 10-match series.Hazlewood was named man of the series for his 11-wicket haul.Next up for West Indies is a four-Test home series against India starting on July 21, while Australia start a three-Test series in Sri Lanka on July 26.",6/27/16,Australia beat West Indies to claim tri nation seri,,,2095,"EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey: Lionel Messi has said that he is to retire from international soccer after Argentina were beaten 4-2 by Chile in a penalty shootout in the Copa America final on Sunday, the fourth final the Barcelona striker has lost with the national side.",6/27/16,Messi says he has retired from internati,,,2096,"LILLE, FRANCE: Germany's Julien Draxler repaid the faith of coach Joachim Low with a dazzling display featuring a volleyed goal and an assist as they thumped Slovakia 3-0 to book a Euro 2016 quarter-final with holders Spain or Italy.DEFLECTED VOLLEY",6/27/16,Draxler dazzles as Germany cruise into last eig,,,2097,NEW JERSEY: Chile upset favourites Argentina with a penalty shootout victory in the Copa America final at MetLife Stadium on Sunday to retain their title in the world's oldest continental soccer competition.,6/27/16,Chile clinch Copa America title in shootou,,,2098,"Toulouse: Eden Hazard scored his first goal of Euro 2016 as Belgium cruised into the quarter-finals with a 4-0 win to end Hungary's fairytale campaign.Hungary impressively won their group but if they struck any fear into the hearts of Belgium's players, it did not show.From Kevin De Bruyne's speculative fourth-minute strike that sailed Gabor Kiraly's crossbar, the Red Devils were too hot for a Hungary making their return to a major tournament three decades after the 1986 World Cup.Almost from kick-off, Kiraly was kept busy as Romelu Lukaku, then De Bruyne, after Hazard's superb delivery, tested the goalkeeper.When Adam Lang hauled De Bruyne to the ground on the left flank, the Manchester City forward promptly dished out the punishment with a superb inswinging free-kick thatAlderweireld headed past Kiraly at his back post. The opener settled Belgian nerves and Hazard in particular dazzled fans with some mazy runs, dribbles, and sublime passes that carved open the Hungarian defence.Despite their attractive football, a lack of clinical finishing left Belgium at risk during an encouraging Hungary fightback in the second half.Kiraly did well to block De Bruyne's effort with his feet after he powered on to Lukaku's sweeping pass behind the Hungarian defence.But De Bruyne headed Lukaku's perfectly-weighted chip into Kiraly's arms. And when Zoltan Gera gave possession away cheaply in midfield, Lukaku's one-two with Radja Nainggolan saw the Everton striker skew wide as De Bruyne ran in unmarked at the back post.Dries Mertens won a free kick when he was charged from behind by Tamas Kadar but De Bruyne's superbly-struck free kick bounced off Kiraly's crossbar.The best of Hungary's few chances came just before the interval when midfielder Gergo Lovrencsics let fly a rasping drive that sailed just over.Moments later, Thibaut Courtois was at full stretch when Balazs Dzsudzsak fired between Nainggolan's legs.Belgium spurned another chance on the stroke of half-time when Mertens' close-range shot was deflected by Adam Lang.Immediately after the restart, Kiraly palmed over Hazard's right-footed drive, but Hungary came fighting back. Striker Adam Szalai fired into the side-netting before rising above the Belgian defence to send a deflected header wide.Adam Pinter's deflected lob forced Courtois to tip over, and then Roland Juhasz heading well wide from the resulting corner.But Belgium responded in style.Michy Batshuayi came off the bench to punish Hungary when he ran in unmarked after the hour to first-time his shot past Kiraly.The 'keeper was then left clutching at thin air when Hazard ran across the edge of the area unchallenged to beat him at his far post.Carrasco added their fourth in the first minute of added on time when he powered down the middle on the counter to beat Kiraly.",6/27/16,Belgium hit four past Hungary at Euro 2016,,,2099,"East Rutherford:Lionel Messi will bid to end Argentina's 23-year wait for a major title later Sunday as his team faces holders Chile in the final of the Copa America Centenario.Argentina and Messi have been in sparkling form en route to Sunday's showpiece, rattling in18 goals in five games.But Martino said his team would be more than happy to sacrifice style for the substance of solid silverware.""The only important thing is winning. How we do it is secondary,"" Martino said.""The only thing to worry about now is winning tomorrow's game. The people want it, the players all want it, we all want it.""And that's why we're willing to give our all to turn around last year's result.""Argentina were beaten on penalties by Chile in last year's final in Santiago after 120 minutes finished level at 0-0.'Can't lose another'""We've been in spectacular form up to now.

We're used to playing in finals -- unfortunately we haven't won one yet.""Messi, who became Argentina's all-time leading goalscorer with his 55th international goal in the semi-final win over the United States, will need to find a way through a fiercely combative Chilean side who are busily plotting another ambush.Argentina defeated Chile 2-1 during the group stage earlier this month, but have improved steadily as the tournament progressed.A 7-0 destruction of Mexico in the quarter-finals was followed by a clinical 2-0 dispatching of Colombia in the last four.""They are a team that presses you, and don't let you play,"" Messi said in comments to reporters on Friday. ""And when they have the ball they play very well.""Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said ""La Roja"" would have a plan ready to contain Messi, making it likely that the spiky midfield qualities of Gary

included a recall for Raheem Sterling.The Manchester City forward was criticised for some insipid group-stage displays, but he made an excellent start, racing onto Daniel Sturridge's fine pass and

While the shake-up would guarantee cricket's leading nations play each other every other year, the other sides would be starved of matches which draw in crowds and lucrative broadcast deals.As things stand, the two latest arrivals at cricket's top table -- Bangladesh and Zimbabwe -- will be doomed to the second tier and could be joined by another relative newcomer Sri Lanka.""This will spell the death of international cricket as we've known it,"" said Ahmed Sazzadul Alam, a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) director.Bangladesh lobbied for years to join cricket's elite before playing their first Test in 2000. Their record has been poor, winning just seven of their 93 Tests and they are currently ranked ninth, just above Zimbabwe.However, performances have improved significantly of late and Bangladesh have only lost six of their last 18 Tests.BCB vice president Mahbubul Anam warned Bangladesh ""would go backwards"" if they stop playing teams such as England and India, both of whom they are due to play later this year. ""The more we play against competitive sides, the better we'll get,"" said Anam.Alistair Campbell, a former director of Zimbabwe's board, appreciated the arguments for a split because of the gulf in class between the top and bottom sides.But Campbell, a former captain who played in Zimbabwe's inaugural Test against India in 1992, said it would be heartbreaking if current players would never be able to compete against the best.""It's going to be a tragedy if you are growing up in a country like Zimbabwe or Bangladesh,"" he told AFP. ""It means you might never get the opportunity to play with top tier sides.

But Amir struck with his 14th ball back in first-class cricket on English soil.Left-hander Trescothick, on eight, could only edge a superb outswinger that moved late and wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed held an excellent diving catch.Amir had another wicket when a full-length inswinger bowled first-class debutant Adam Hose (10).And eight minutes after lunch, Amir bowled Peter Trego (23) with another fine inswinger that knocked over the batsman's middle stump and left the other two standing.""He bowled very well,"" said the 40-year-old Trescothick, whose nine-balls faced on Monday were all bowled by Amir, after stumps.""He swung the ball really late, that's the biggest thing we noticed.""In my 'magnificent' eight I thought it was pretty hard work, it was tricky,"" added Trescothick, who in 76 Tests from 2000-2006 scored 5,825 runs at an average of nearly 44 with 14 hundreds.'Guessing'",7/5/16,Trescothick issues Amir warning,,,2172,"Paralympic gold medallist Oscar Pistorius will not appeal a six-year prison sentence given by a South African High Court judge on Wednesday for the 2013 murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, his defence team said.",7/6/16,Pistorius defence team say will not appeal six year,,,2173,"BARCELONA: Barcelona soccer star Lionel Messi has been sentenced to 21 months in prison after a court in Barcelona found him guilty of three counts of tax fraud, a statement from the court said on Wednesday.",7/6/16,Barcelona soccer star Messi sentenced to 21 months in pri,,,2174,"MELBOURNE: Australia's cricket board has banned two players for betting on matches and given a suspended ban to a third as part of its ""zero tolerance"" approach to gambling-related corruption.Hayley Jensen and Corinne Hall, who play in the national women's league and women's domestic Twenty20 tournament, were both given two-year bans with 18 months suspended, Cricket Australia said in a media release on Wednesday.Jensen had admitted placing one bet on the result of the men's test match between Australia and New Zealand in Brisbane last November.Hall had made two bets relating to two matches in the men's domestic one-day competition in 2015-16.""Jensen and Hall are prohibited from participating in any form of cricket or cricket-related event for a period of six months until 21 October 2016,"" CA said.Joel Logan, who plays for South Australia in the men's domestic competition, was sanctioned for placing two bets on the winner of the World T20 tournament.Logan was also given a two-year ban but it was wholly suspended due to ""circumstances relating to his match contracts and the specific timing"" of his bets.All three players were required to participate in anti-corruption education programs, the board said.""We take a proactive, zero-tolerance approach to maintaining the integrity of our sport and this includes any form of betting on cricket globally,"" CA's integrity boss Iain Roy said.These players have accepted the seriousness of their errors and have voluntarily accepted their sanctions.""CA in February banned 19-year-old women's cricketer Piepa Cleary for six months, with another 18 months suspended, for placing six bets totalling A$15.50 ($11.50) on a men's test match between Australia and New Zealand in November.That followed a two-year suspended sentence given to Sydney-based women's cricketer Angela Reakes in December for placing five bets worth a total of A$9 on the man-of-the-match for last year's cricket World Cup final.",7/6/16,Australia board slaps bans on three players for betting,,,2175,"EVIAN: Germany coach Joachim Loew has been forced to make changes to his team for Thursday's semi-final against hosts France at Euro 2016 because of injuries and a suspension, including replacing key goalscorer Mario Gomez.",7/6/16,Germany forced to make key changes for semi fi,,,2176,Southampton: Josh Buttler led England to an eight-wicket victory in the T20 international against Sri Lanka in Southampton on Tuesday.,7/6/16,England beat Sri Lanka by eight wickets in T20 internati,,,2177,"Marseille: More than 15,000 Germany fans led the latest Euro 2016 invasion of Marseille on Thursday ahead of their country's key semi-final clash against France, while excitement built in the host nation.- Misers and hot shots -",7/7/16,Party atmosphere as France Germany clash in semi fi,,,2178,"LONDON: Mohammad Amir should be allowed to ""move on with his life"", former England captain Michael Atherton said Thursday.",7/7/16,Atherton insists Amir has served his ti,,,2179,LONDON: England's all-time leading wicket-taker James Anderson was ruled out of a 12-man squad announced Thursday for next week's first Test against Pakistan at Lord's.England squad:,7/7/16,Englands Anderson out first Pakistan T,,,2180,LONDON;

Even if Portugal can snuff out Griezmann, Dmitiri Payet, the stand-out performer in the earlier rounds, can change a game in seconds.Front man Olivier Giroud has also proved a handful by weighing on defences and making space for those around him.TEAM SPIRITNO DEPENDENCY ON RONALDO",7/8/16,Griezmann and Ronaldo clash in final for second time in six,,,2188,"LENS, FRANCE: Czech Republic goalkeeper Petr Cech announced his retirement from international soccer on Friday following his country's group stage exit at Euro 2016.",7/8/16,Czech veteran Cech announces international retir,,,2189,"SEOUL: South Korean swimming star Park Tae-Hwan, who was barred from the Olympics for doping, will compete for the national team in Rio after the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) ruled in his favour.The multiple Olympic medallist had sought ""an urgent ruling"" from the Lausanne-based body against his doping ban by July 8 -- the deadline for South Korea to select their Rio swimming team.""We will include Park Tae-Hwan in the list of national athletes who will take part in the Rio Olympics"", Korean Olympic Committee (KOC) Secretary General Cho Young-Ho was quoted as saying by Yonhap news agency.Park, 26, was slapped with an 18-month suspension after testing positive for an anabolic steroid in out-of-competition controls before the 2014 Asian Games.The ban lapsed in April, but Park remained barred from the 2016 Olympics under a KOC rule which prohibits athletes from representing the country for three years after a doping ban expires.CAS ruled Friday that KOC's extended ban constituted a double jeopardy for Park and should be nullified, according to KOC.South Korea's Olympic committee had said earlier Friday it would abide by the CAS ruling.Park -- once the poster boy of South Korean swimming before the doping scandal -- has repeatedly begged for a chance to compete in what would be his third, and probably last, Olympics.He won 400m freestyle gold and 200m freestyle silver at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and two silver medals at the 2012 London Olympics, as well as 400m world titles in 2007 and 2011.'",7/8/16,Swimming S Korea to include Park for Rio Olympi,,,2190,"HOVE: Pakistan in their second warm-up match were put into bat after Sussex captain Ben Brown won the toss and elected to field first here on Friday.Pakistan made two changes from their team played against Somerset in their first warm-up.

When Pakistan do return to their own beds, a few of their bowlers might want to check under them to ensure Beaumont and Winfield are nowhere to be seen. Both their half-centuries were typical of their play over the last month: Winfield willing and on the front foot, Beaumont wristy and devastating.'The familiarity spread right through'to the game's conclusion. Pakistan were run ragged in the field and, facing a total they had no intention of chasing -'Danni Wyatt pilfered 11 from the first four balls of the final over to help England set 170 -'it was just a matter or whether they would be bowled out in the allotted time. In the end, they finished seven wickets down and 57 short.''England rang changes with the ball, the most noticeable being left-armer Tash Farrant coming in for Katherine Brunt. Having made her debut at the age of 17, Farrant spent two years on the sidelines from January 2014 to February 2016, when Mark Robinson gave her a run out in England's final T20I before the World T20.'Hers is an example he was keen to address: a player picked young yet too young to cope with being dropped and overlooked for a prolonged'period. Now 20, she looked'at ease, cycling through her variations and even nabbing the wicket of opener Nahida Khan with a slower ball that was'flat-batted back to her. There were first international wickets, too, for Alex Hartley.''Talking about how easy you find things is one of cricket's great taboos, but even Heather Knight, a measured individual who seems to cringe at her own success, might wonder what all the fuss of captaining your country is about.''From the early part of Robinson's tenure as head coach, it was evident that both he and Knight were on the same page. In one of their first coach-player interactions, Knight said she wanted to move away from feeling like'the onus is on her to bat for as long as possible. She wanted freedom.'As captain, she has been able to afford that to the rest of her team. All this while questions were being'asked of whether life after Charlotte Edwards would really be so rosy.'Those answers will not be able to be given just yet, but Knight was understandably punchy in the press conference.''""There was a lot of noise around the squad before the series and the girls have responded. The cricket we have played has been really entertaining to watch. Everyone is feeding off the success of each other and it's been a really nice place to be.""'That last point is key. Perhaps one of the most noticeable elements of this England side is how much more open they seem. And while players young and experienced have commented on how Robinson has created a relaxed atmosphere, it has been particularly clear'to former players no longer in the system.''Caroline Atkins, who represented England between 2001 and 2011, was taken aback at how at ease the players were when she was around the team at Taunton as they prepared for the third ODI. It was not an atmosphere she was used to. Isa Guha and Ebony-Jewel Rainford-Brent have also presented caps to debutants during this tour, something that has rarely happened in English women's cricket. Rainford-Brent, who' presented Hartley with her T20 cap before this match, was even invited into the team huddle -'a ringed haven usually reserved for squad members.'''There are of course elements that still need work. On a personnel level, Kate Cross' return to international cricket, after an impressive pre-season tour of Sri Lanka with the England Academy, was disappointing, as she took'1 for 56 from the 11 overs she bowled across the first two ODIs. Cross will spend the next few weeks up to the'inaugural Women's Super League fine-tuning some technical aspects of her game, such as her front arm, before leading the Lancashire Tunder in what is hoped to be a testing'fortnight of high-level'cricket. She will hope her name will be added to the long list of seamers Robinson has healed.''Long term, it will be interesting to see whether the confidence gained from these six matches can carry through into something more sustainable.

Wells drove flat-footed at a full delivery, edging behind seven short of a century, then Matt Machan was almost yorked first ball before being beaten by his second delivery.Finch, opening the batting for the first time in first-class cricket, reached his century in Wahab's next over, when he square-drove his 16th boundary, but two balls later was tempted into driving a full delivery and edged to slip.At the Sea End, Imran Khan picked up a brace himself, although they owed a little more to the batsmen's errors. Machan was lbw after a horrid swipe across the line then Ben Brown drove loosely at his first ball: 212 without loss had become 233 for 4 in the blink of an eye.Wells' innings was a continuation of a strong run of form for the tall left-hander who had made 181 last week against Glamorgan. His fifty off 54 balls included 10 boundaries and seven more followed before Wahab found his edge.Finch, whose previous first-class hundred had come against Leeds/Bradford MCCU at the start of this season, gave one chance on 64 when he drove low to short cover off Zulfiqar Babar, but he was particularly impressive on the front foot.

part of a sting operation carried out by a tabloid newspaper.All three received five-year bans from cricket and, together with sports agent Mazhar Majeed, jail terms.For all his time out of cricket,

to take a five-wicket haul in a Test innings at Lord's to leave Pakistan well-placed at stumps on Friday's second day of their series opener with England.At the close, England were 253 for seven in reply to Pakistan's first innings 339 -- a deficit of 86 runs, with Chris Woakes 31 not out.Shah, in his first Test since serving a three-month drugs ban -- and his first outside of Asia and the United Arab Emirates -- ran through England's middle-order on the way to five for 64 in 25 overs.It was the first time any leg-spinner had taken five or more wickets in a Test innings at Lord's since his compatriot Mushtaq Ahmed's five for 57 in 1996.Earlier, England captain Alastair Cook made 81 and in the process surpassed India great Sunil Gavaskar as the highest run-scoring opening batsman in Test history.But, in sight of a century, he became Mohammad Amir's first Test wicket in six years when the left-arm quick, who twice had Cook dropped, got him to play on.Amir, was making his return to Test cricket at Lord's -- the scene of his 2010 spot-fixing crime which saw him given a five-year ban and a jail term for deliberately bowling no balls.Amir should have had Cook out for 22 when an excellent delivery took the outside edge only for first slip Mohammad Hafeez to drop the routine catch.It was a similar story when left-hander Cook, now on 55, again edged Amir but wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed floored the seemingly simple two-handed chance.Amir screamed in frustration before sharing a wry smile with captain Misbah-ul-Haq, who gave the 24-year-old paceman a consoling pat on the back.After the early loss of opener Alex Hales, Cook and new number three Joe Root shared a stand of 110.Cook, belying his reputation as a steady run-maker, struck three fours in four balls as Rahat Ali strayed onto the left-hander's pads. But Shah turned the tide when he had Root carelessly hole out off a miscued sweep on 48.James Vince and the recalled Gary Ballance were both lbw as they each failed to 'pick' Shah.Cook's cut four off Amir took him to 61 and beyond Gavaskar's mark of 9,607 runs as a Test opener.Amir eventually drew Cook wide and got the left-hander to play on to end a 124-ball innings featuring 12 fours.Jonny Bairstow had rescued England from many a top-order slump in recent times. But on Friday he was deceived into playing back to Shah and bowled by a top-spinner for 29.That left England 193 for six and they were 232 for seven when, after a prolonged review, Yasir won a tight 'umpire's call' decision to have Moeen Ali lbw on the sweep for 23.Even before Ali's exit had finally been confirmed, Shah had saluted his fifth wicket Friday by kissing the turf. It was the fifth time in just 13 Tests that the 30-year-old Shah had taken five or more wickets in an innings.Earlier, Woakes took a Test-best six for 70 as Pakistan, 282 for six overnight, were bowled out for 339.Misbah only added four to his overnight 110 not out before he was bowled by Stuart Broad.Amir, booed by a small section of a capacity crowd as he walked out to bat, inside edged his first ball in Test cricket in six years, from Broad, for four and was hit on the helmet next delivery when he ducked into another Broad ball. He was last man out for 12, caught in the slips off Broad.",7/15/16,Yasir runs through England as Amir strikes at,,,2244,"LONDON: Pakistan's Mohammad Amir took his first Test wicket in six years when be bowled England captain Alastair Cook at Lord's on Friday.Amir was making his return to Test cricket at the scene of his 2010 spot-fixing crime which saw him given a five-year ban and a jail term for deliberately bowling no balls as part of a newspaper 'sting' during that year's Lord's Test against England.The 24-year-old paceman suffered the frustration Friday of seeing fellow left-hander Cook dropped off his bowling by slip Mohammad Hafeez and wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed, who both missed routine chances, when the opener was on 22 and 55 respectively.But with Cook in sight of a hundred on the second day of the first of a four-Test series, Amir took the fielders out of the equation by inducing Cook to play on for 81.That left England 171 for five in reply to Pakistan's first innings 339 -- a deficit of 168 runs.At that stage, Amir had taken one for 46 in 12.2 overs, with his 52nd Test wicket coming in his 15th match at this level.Cook, always a prize wicket for any opposition bowler, had suggested before this match that if it were down to him, all fixers, including Amir, would be banned for life.However, the England skipper added that as Amir had ""served his time"" he had ""no problems"" in playing against him in this four-match series.By dismissing Cook, Amir had taken his first wicket in a Test match since he dismissed England's Graeme Swann on his way to figures of six for 84 in an innings and 225-run defeat for Pakistan at Lord's in 2010 -- a result overshadowed by the spot-fixing scandal.Amir struggled for line and length early in his spell Friday but became increasingly effective as the sunny skies above Lord's gave way to swing-friendly grey clouds.Cook, on 22, was drawn forward by an excellent delivery only for first slip Hafeez to drop the straightforward catch.It was a similar story when Cook, now on 55, again edged Amir but Sarfraz Ahmed, going slightly to his left, floored the two-handed chance. Amir screamed in frustration before sharing a wry smile with Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq, who gave the bowler a consoling pat on the back.The floppy hair Amir sported as a teenage may have given away to a shorter cut and his once clean shaven face may now be home to a goatee beard, but when Cook was out there was no mistaking Amir's trademark arms outstretched 'airplane' celebration.Earlier on Friday, tailender Amir was booed by a small section of a capacity crowd as he walked out to bat.He inside edged his first ball, from Stuart Broad, for four. Next ball he was hit on the helmet as he ducked into a Broad delivery. But Amir also hit two well-struck boundaries before he was last man out for 12, caught in the slips off Broad.'",7/15/16,Amir snares Cook for first wicket of Test retur,,,2245,"After being rattled out inside the first hour at Lord's, Pakistan needed to take their chances with the ball in order for their first-innings 339 to assume more daunting proportions. They proceeded to drop Alastair Cook twice, with his unbeaten 75 anchoring the England reply, but three wickets during the afternoon session for Yasir Shah kept Pakistan in the hunt.Chris Woakes' maiden five-wicket haul in Tests had helped finish off Pakistan with only 57 added to their overnight score before the stage was transported back to 2010, as Mohammad Amir prepared to bowl to Cook once again. Amir had previously removed Cook three times in five Tests and he should have added to that tally here but for glaring errors by Mohammad Hafeez, at first slip, and wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed.Cook put on 110 with Joe Root for the second wicket but Yasir struck for his first Test wickets outside of Asia to check England's advance. Root, in his first innings replacing Nick Compton at No. 3, looked at something like his dynamic best before trying slightly too hard to force the pace and top-edging a slog-sweep off Yasir straight up in the air to be taken at midwicket.That gave Pakistan a look at England's reshaped middle-order, with James Vince moving up to No. 4 above the recalled Gary Ballance. Vince briefly shimmered on an otherwise dull, cloudy afternoon, before playing back to be lbw to Yasir - DRS confirming it would have clipped leg stump - for a fifth innings without a significant score at Test level. Ballance clipped one four but was then beaten by a gently turning legbreak, pushing down the wrong line, to leave England 153 for 4 at tea.Amir's first delivery in Test cricket after a five-year ban for his involvement in spot-fixing on this ground was met by a few pseudo-witty cries of ""no-ball"" from the crowd and it was unceremoniously tucked away into the covers for a single by Cook. Amir struggled with his line and length, leaking 33 runs from six overs before lunch, but ought to have removed the England captain when he had made 22, slanting the ball in to take the edge just as he did as a teenager, only for Hafeez to make a mess of a straightforward low catch.Rahat Ali was more accurate with the new ball and he picked up Alex Hales in his first over, angling a delivery across to have him taken at third slip. Cook took advantage of too many deliveries on his pads to pick up seven boundaries - including another edge through the cordon off Amir - and score at more than a run a ball, as he and Root ticked up a fifty stand before lunch.There was further anguish for Amir when he began his second spell during the afternoon, his first delivery luring Cook into a drive as the ball left him, only for the ball to hit Sarfraz on the wrist as he dived to his left.In the morning session, a burst of three wickets in eight balls, including the dismissal of Misbah-ul-Haq for 114, had helped England wrap up Pakistan's innings. Woakes collected two of them to finish with 6 for 70 and join Misbah in having his name added to the honours board. Having been 282 for 4 shortly before the close on Thursday, Pakistan would have been disappointed to make only 339.Misbah, fresh from becoming the oldest captain to score a Test hundred, began the second day with designs on seeing his side up towards 400 and a secure position from which his bowlers could mount an attack. He could only add four runs to his overnight score, however, before Stuart Broad brought a delivery back to burst between bat and pad and rattle the stumps.That dismissal meant Pakistan had gone from 310 for 7 to 316 for 9, with Woakes removing Ahmed and Wahab Riaz in the preceding over. Sarfraz had looked in dangerous mood, frequently stepping down the pitch to cut and drive on his way to 25 from 29 deliveries but he gifted his wicket when slapping a short, wide delivery to backward point to give Woakes his maiden five-for.Two deliveries later, Wahab was following Sarfraz back to the pavilion, as Woakes followed up an excellent outswinger with one of the fastest balls of the match, full and ducking in past a flimsy defence to remove off stump from the ground.As the crowd applauded Woakes' achievements, Amir walked out for his first involvement in a Test since the corresponding Lord's Test in 2010. This was not the main event, of course, but he helped add 23 runs for the final wicket with Yasir Shah in an eventful cameo: his first ball was inside-edged for four over his stumps, the second, also from Broad, went flying off the back of his helmet. There were a couple more genuine boundary strokes before Amir steered Broad to second slip to complete a good morning's work for England.",7/15/16,Cook dropped twice as England reach 153 4 at,,,2246,"NEW DELHI: England will embark on their lengthy tour of India later this year with Rajkot hosting the first of the five Test matches from Nov. 9, the cricket boards announced on Friday.The western Indian city of Rajkot will be making its debut as a Test venue in the series, as will be coastal Vishakapatnam, which hosts the second Test from Nov. 17.Mohali, Mumbai and Chennai will host the remaining matches of what would be England's first five-Test rubber in India since 1984-85.Beginning on Jan. 15, England will also play three one-dayers and as many Twenty20 Internationals.""This promises to be a historic Test series and a great opportunity for Alastair Cook and his players to repeat the memorable Test series win we enjoyed on our last trip to India in 2012,"" Andrew Strauss, Director England Cricket, said in a statement.""Equally, Eoin Morgan's white-ball squad will be anticipating hard-fought and competitive encounters against high quality opposition in both formats."" he added.Schedule:Nov. 9-13: 1st Test, RajkotNov.17-21: 2nd Test, VishakapatnamNov.26-30: 3rd Test, MohaliDec.8-12: 4th Test, MumbaiDec.16-20: 5th Test, ChennaiJan.15: 1st ODI, PuneJan.19: 2nd ODI, CuttackJan.22: 3rd ODI, KolkataJan.26: 1st T20, KanpuJan.29: 2nd T20, NagpuFeb.1: 3rd T20, Bangalore",7/15/16,England to begin Test series in India at new venue Raj,,,2247,LONDON: Mohammad Amir was denied a wicket on his long-awaited return to Test cricket as England dominated the second morning of the first Test at Lord's on Friday.,7/15/16,Mohammad Amir denied England domi,,,2248,LORDS: Pakistan were dismissed for 339 runs on day 2 of the first test match by a rejuvenated English side.',7/15/16,England dismiss Pakistan for 339 in first inning,,,2249,LONDON: Fast bowler Jake Ball hoped that his performance on his test debut against Pakistan would help silence those critics who questioned his inclusion in the team.,7/15/16,Englands Jake Ball eager prove critics wrong,,,2250,"LONDON: Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq said his unbeaten century against England at Lord's on Thursday was the ""top innings"" of an impressive Test career.- 'Honour code' -",7/15/16,Promised army guys 10 push ups century Misb,,,2251,ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has bought four bulletproof buses as it tries to convince other teams to shed their security apprehensions and visit the country.,7/15/16,Pakistan buys bulletproof buses woo back visiting,,,2252,"LAHORE: Pakistan's sporting decline has left the vast South Asian nation that once prided itself on producing the world's best hockey and squash players facing up to an Olympics for which none of its athletes have qualified.1980s TRAINING METHODSThose in charge of promoting sport in Pakistan despair.The grassroots system is almost non-existent, children in schools'rarely play a sport which is not cricket, and top athletes seldom compete against the world's best as cash-strapped federations cannot afford to send them abroad. Waqar Ahmed, deputy director of the Pakistan Sports Board, said federations also cannot afford to hire top coaches familiar with scientific training techniques and end up relying on Pakistani trainers with ""obsolete"" methods from the 1980s. ""Athletes are really frustrated because... the coaches are not literate and they have been teaching what they were taught 30 years back,"" he said. ""Without infrastructure we can do a lot, but without the techniques you cannot win."" The demise of hockey, Pakistan's national sport, has been painful to watch for an older generation who prospered during the halcyon days between 1960 and 1994, when Pakistan regularly won Olympic gold medals and world championships. Tahir Zaman, Pakistan hockey team coach, said the lack of government support means many young athletes no longer see a future in sports like hockey where top players get $10 per day. Pakistani cricketers, by contrast, are paid $5,000 monthly retainers and make a fortune from sponsorship deals. ""The attraction is not there anymore. The (government) is not offering regular jobs for players,"" said Zaman, who won a bronze playing for Pakistan at the 1992 Olympics. At Lahore's empty 45,000-seat hockey stadium, Pakistani hockey player Hassan Anwar, 21, said that as a teenager his family begged him: ""please don't play hockey if you want a bright future"". The demise of hockey has been mirrored by the decline in the Pakistani squash scene, where young players know all about 1980s legend Jahangir Khan - considered the greatest ever squash player - but none match his bravura on the court. WOMEN HARASSEDPakistan's best known squash player is Maria Toorpakay Wazir, ranked 65 in the world, but to train she spent years dressing and pretending to be a boy in the ultra-conservative tribal areas near Afghanistan. Now she trains abroad. Pakistan Olympic chief Hasan says societal ""barriers are coming down"" for women but many female athletes rue the slow pace of change. At 16, Neelam Riaz's first love was cycling, but her father banned her from training on roads as men would stare at her. In response, she took up karate to learn how to fend off men and eventually stumbled on weightlifting. ""Usually in Pakistan girls are discouraged from sports, and often coaches push back,"" said Riaz, 25, who last year became a national champion and Pakistan's first female weightlifter to compete abroad. ""Now my family is happy with me doing weightlifting."" In a dimly lit Lahore gym, where paint peels off walls, windows are shattered and cobwebs cling to a damp ceiling, Riaz is tutoring 16-year-old Iqra Chanzaib, who is new to weightlifting. Chanzaib wanted to play basketball, but the only hoop near her house was out in the open and full of boys, so one of her pious brothers protested. She then opted for weightlifting, indoors. ""There are plenty of girls like me but they cannot come because of family pressures. My own friends want to come but their families stop them,"" she said.",7/15/16,Pakistan sport hits low point with qualifying deb,,,2253,"LONDON: Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq became the oldest player to score a Test century for 82 years as he helped his side recover against England at Lord's on Thursday.Costly Ali But off-spinner Moeen Ali was expensive, his seven wicketless overs costing 46 runs.The 42-year-old Misbah's achievement was all the more impressive as this was also his first Test at the 'home of cricket'.Not since England's Patsy Hendren made a century against Australia aged 45 at' Manchester's Old Trafford ground back in 1934 had an older player scored a Test hundred.Remarkably, this was also Misbah's first Test anywhere in England. It looked as if Misbah was about to celebrate his achievement by prostrating himself on the turf in prayer.But instead he performed a series of press-ups in what appeared to be a joke aimed at critics who questioned whether he is now too old for international cricket.The gesture also a wry reference to the pre-tour 'army-style' training camp the squad were put through at the Pakistan Military Academy in the northwestern town of Kakul.""A lot of things have been said about my technique and the outside edge, and the' celebration... I promised the guys,"" Misbah told Sky Sports.""We had an Army camp and every time we had to get down and do 10 press-ups. ""Those in my celebration can't count because my arm was bent!""On a more serious note, and turning to the match situation, Misbah said: ""We're in a good position at the moment. We really want to score another 100 runs to give us a good chance.Misbah was dropped on 16 by Joe Root, who grassed a tough slip chance off fast bowler Steven Finn.And he would have been run out for 58 after a mix-up with Shafiq if Gary Ballance had hit the stumps.Misbah was severe on Ali, reverse and conventionally sweeping him for four fours in an over.Another reverse sweep off Ali took him to 99.A single to third man off Finn saw Misbah to his 10th century in 62 Tests off 154 balls with 17 boundaries.All the pre-match hype had concerned Pakistan paceman Mohammad Amir, making his return to Test cricket at Lord's -- the scene of his 2010 spot-fixing crime.But Amir, who served a five-year ban, remained a spectator on Thursday. Pakistan's openers got through the new ball ball before first-change Woakes removed them both with a burst of two wickets for five runs in 16 balls.Shan Masood was caught behind by Jonny Bairstow. Woakes and Bairstow combined again to have Mohammad Hafeez (40) caught off a skyer.Pakistan were 76 for two shortly after lunch when Azhar Ali was literally knocked off his feet by a yorker from Jake Ball, given a Test debut after the selectors decided against risking England's all-time leading wicket-taker James Anderson following a shoulder injury.Ali reviewed and Nottinghamshire quick Ball had an anxious wait before a tight 'umpire's call' verdict gave him a first Test wicket.""I really enjoyed my wicket,"" said Ball. ""When he reviewed it, I was nervous because it looked like it was sliding down but to see it clipping leg stump was really nice.""Younis Khan made an elegant 33 before he carelessly chipped Stuart Broad to Ali at square leg.But Shafiq offered excellent support with a 130-ball innings featuring 12 fours.

Asad Shafiq struck a well-made 49 before,in sight of his second fifty of the match, he was bowled by a Woakes 'trimmer'.Earlier, Shah produced the best innings bowling by a visiting spinner against England in a Test at Lord's since Sid Pegler's seven for 65 for South Africa back in 1912.Variations in pace and flight saw Shah repeatedly pose problems on an unresponsive pitch.Both sides knew that Shah was likely to be an even greater threat on a wearing fourth-day surface on Sunday.England resumed on their overnight 253 for seven, after Shah induced a middle-order collapse on Friday.They added just 19 more runs Saturday, with Woakes on 35 not out as he emphasised his all-round credentials.'",7/16/16,Yasir stars with bat despite Woakes heroi,,,2255,"LONDON: Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq followed his first-innings hundred with a duck as England fought back on the third day of the first Test at Lord's on Saturday.At tea, Pakistan were 111 for four in their second innings -- a lead of 178 runs.A becalmed Younis Khan, who played several exaggerated leave shots, was 19 not out off 86 balls.But Asad Shafiq had kept the scoreboard ticking over with an unbeaten 29 off 46 balls including five boundaries.Saturday's second session saw England all-rounder Chris Woakes follow his Test-best six for 70 in the first innings with two wickets.Pakistan were 40 for one at lunch after Mohammad Hafeez had carelessly fallen for a duck in cutting Stuart Broad straight to Joe Root at second slip.But they lost opener Shan Masood soon afterwards when the left-hander, once more fallible outside off stump, flat-footedly edged Warwickshire paceman Woakes to England captain Alastair Cook at first slip.Azhar Ali (23) then fell lbw to a desperately tight umpire's call as Woakes reduced Pakistan to 59 for three.Misbah, in his maiden Test knock at Lord's, had made 114 in Pakistan's first innings.But on Saturday he fell for nought when he hoisted off-spinner Moeen Ali legside and Alex Hales, running round to the mid-wicket rope, held a good catch.Pakistan had never previously lost a Test when Misbah had made a hundred and never won one when he had made a duck.With conditions set fair on a sunny day at Lord's and more than two days left in the match, something had to give.Younis, on 11, was given out lbw by umpire Joel Wilson after a prolonged and theatrical appeal from fast bowler Steven Finn on his Middlesex home ground. But a review showed the ball missing leg stump and Younis survived.Earlier, leg-spinner Yasir Shah took six wickets as England were bowled out for 272 -- 67 runs behind on first innings.Shah's haul of six for 72 was the best return by a visiting spinner against England at Lord's since Sid Pegler's seven for 65 for South Africa back in 1912.

Kohli himself batted at 4.2 an over.Apart from Shannon Gabriel, no bowler - there was only one more specialist in the side - actively looked out for wickets, relying on frustrating batsmen. However, captain Kohli, India's first to score an away double, took risks and made the bowlers bowl to him because he was driving the wide ones too.Gabriel, though, should have had a wicket added to his one from day one early on the second day. Shane Dowrich had waited for 423 overs over three Tests for his first opportunity for a dismissal, but Gabriel produced the outside edge from Ashwin for a sitter, his eagerness to celebrate led to the sitter's being grassed. West Indies still managed to keep Ashwin quiet - at one point he went 40 balls for four runs - but Kohli kept finding a way around the defensive lines.Cover driving, as usual, remained the feature of Kohli's innings. When he gave the treatment to Devendra Bishoo in the 105th over, the boundary took him past his previous best of 169; it was his 50th run through the covers. A sign of how well he batted came in how, in the 113th over, he played perhaps the only ungainly shot of his innings, a half-sweep across the line to deep midwicket. Turned out he had picked the rare wrong'un from Bishoo, and was actually playing with the spin.Slow pitch, fielders in front, no pace to work with, and West Indies finally had a quiet session. Ashwin didn't look in any hurry, Wriddhiman Saha tried to break the monotony, succeeding on a couple of occasions before getting stumped to finally give Dowrich a maiden Test dismissal. Overall, though, West Indies refused to attack, which could also give India scoring opportunities, and India didn't seem overly bothered with the slow going.Seven minutes before tea, with a back-foot punch through midwicket, Ashwin brought up his hundred, reminding you of the shot of the day, a back-foot punch through mid-on for four.

Amir took two for 63 and Rahat two for 69, with both men bowling 20 overs on Friday.But star leg-spinner Yasir Shah, who took a man-of-the-match winning 10 wickets at Lord's, returned figures of none for 111 in 31 overs.Amir had opener Alex Hales dropped in the gully on six by Asad Shafiq. But three balls later, having repeatedly moved the ball away from Hales, Amir skilfully swung the ball back into the right-handed opener and knocked over his middle and off stumps.England were now 25 for one after seven overs.At lunch, England were 95 for one with Cook 40 not out and Root 41 not out.  Root just beat Cook to the fifty milestone, getting there in 86 balls to the captain's 90. Cook reached the landmark in style with a straight-driven four -- a clear sign he is in top form -- off Shah.A similar stroke saw him into the 90s and raised the 150 stand.  Cook's two to mid-wicket off Amir saw him to a hundred in 157 balls including 14 fours and the normally restrained Essex batsman celebrated his century with several fist pumps.Left-handed opener Cook's 29th Test century meant he extended his own England record and drew the Essex batsman level with Australia great Don Bradman's tally. Bradman, however, played just 52 Tests while this was Cook's 131st match in the format.More signficantly, this was Cook's first century in 20 Test innings since his monumental 263 against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in October.But Amir then took the shine off an excellent session for England by bowling Cook following an under-edge from a ball that kept low.That became the last delivery before tea, with England 210 for two at the interval.James Vince, looking for a maiden Test fifty to cement his place in the side, fell in all too familiar fashion when, on 18, he chased a wide Rahat delivery outside off stump, with his edged drive caught low down by wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed.What made his dismissal all the worse wast that Vince had been dropped by Younis Khan in the slips off a similar shot when on six off Amir.Root, 87 not out at tea, went to his 10th hundred in 44 Tests with his 14th four in 167 balls when he drove Shah wide of mid-on in textbook fashion.Gary Ballance (23) then helped Yorkshire team-mate Root add on 73 before he chopped on against Rahat.England have not lost a home Test batting first since 2012, a sequence encompassing 10 wins and two draws.",7/22/16,Cook Root tons help England reach 314 4 against Paki,,,2290,"NORTH SOUND, Antigua: Virat Kohli continued his efficient and energetic accumulation of runs to bring up his maiden first-class double hundred, which took India past 400 in the first session of the second day.This was the first away double-century by an India captain. In a wicketless session that went for 102 runs, R Ashwin enjoyed some luck but also displayed some attractive shots; a back-foot punch for four through mid-on was the shot of the session. The partnership between the two swelled to 168.As was the case on day one, Gabriel bowled a short burst with the new ball, which was taken first thing in the morning. He tested Ashwin, who was dropped on 43 by Dowrich, who looked like he was already thinking of celebrating even before completing the simple catch. Jason Holder looked unremarkable at the other end; Carlos Brathwaite did a better job of testing the batsmen's patience with consistent bowling a set of stumps outside off stump.The tactic had kept India's top order quiet in the first session of the match, but Kohli didn't wait for too long before taking a calculated risk, which was executed so well it didn't look like a risk. Kohli has his own way of choosing what balls to drive. Each delivery of Brathwaite's first three overs was bowled to Kohli, who attempted to score off only one, the widest of the lot. It wasn't a half-volley either, but Kohli drove superbly on the up, and got a boundary to break any pressure the joining of dots creates.Cover driving, as usual, remained the feature of Kohli's innings. When he gave the treatment to Devendra Bishoo in the 105th over, the boundary took him past his previous best of 169; it was his 50th run through the covers. A sign of how well he batted came in how, in the 113th over, he played perhaps the only ungainly shot of his innings, a half-sweep across the line to deep midwicket. Turned out he had picked the rare wrong'un from Bishoo, and was actually playing with the spin.No Test double is easy, but in the last over before lunch, Kohli strolled to one of the more inevitable ones with an easy single off a short offbreak. Ashwin, who has two centuries against West Indies to his name, was now looking comfortable with 64 runs at a Test average of 67.80 against West Indies.'",7/22/16,Kohlis first double takes India past 400 against Windi,,,2291,"North Sound, Antigua and Barbuda: 'Virat Kohli stroked a commanding 12th Test century to put India in control at 302 for four when stumps were drawn on the opening day of the first Test against the West Indies on Thursday.Having chosen to bat first on winning the toss, the Indian captain led the way with a thoroughly authoritative innings of 143 not out, decorated with 16 fours that has so far occupied just over four hours off 197 deliveries.He put on 105 for the third wicket with Shikhar Dhawan, the opening batsman missing out on a three-figure innings of his own when he fell lbw for 84 sweeping at Devendra Bishoo on the stroke of the tea interval.Bishoo ended the day with figures of three for 108 off 27 overs. Surprisingly he was not called upon by his captain, Jason Holder, in the first period of play, when even debutant batsman and part-time off-spinner Roston Chase delivered eight overs.However his dismissal of Pujara via a horribly miscued pull in the first over after lunch ushered in Kohli who proceeded to transform the rest of the day into a testament to his ever-increasing stature as a batsman of the highest class.Gabriel removed Murali Vijay for just seven after half-an-hour's play when the right-hander fended at a lifting delivery for Kraigg Brathwaite to take the catch at the second attempt at second slip.Pujara looked untroubled on joining Dhawan at the crease with the pair putting on 60 before the middle-order player's error of judgement at the start of the afternoon session.Having opted to go into the match without uncapped fast-medium bowler Miguel Cummins, the only other pace threat available in the West Indies pre-match squad of 13, it was left to Holder, fellow medium-pacer Carlos Brathwaite and Chase to do the bulk of the early work in support of Gabriel before Bishoo got into his work after lunch.Early in his innings, Kohli passed 3,000 career Test runs and later on reached 1,000 as Test captain. But the most important figures were the partnerships built around his excellent innings.His century stand with Dhawan was followed by a further 60 put together with Rahane followed by a fifth-wicket stand so far worth 66 with Ravichandran Ashwin.With two Test centuries against the West Indies on the Indian sub-continent, the lower-order player will resume on the second morning unbeaten on 22 alongside Kohli.While the West Indies have packed their side with batting, India opted for a bowling attack comprising three pacers and two spinners, omitting Ravindra Jadeja in preference for Amit Mishra to work in tandem with Ashwin as specialist slow bowlers.West Indies have not defeated India in Test cricket for 14 years since the end of the 2002 series in the Caribbean and are the decided underdogs for the first meeting with these opponents on home soil for five years.'",7/22/16,Kohli puts India in charge with 12th Test century,,,2292,"MANCHESTER: Captain Alastair Cook compiled a trademark century to lift England to a commanding 210 for two at tea on the first day of the second Test against Pakistan in Manchester on Friday.Cook, who won the toss in good batting conditions, shared a smooth second-wicket partnership of 185 with Joe Root (87 not out) before being bowled by Mohammad Amir for 105 just before the interval.Pakistan, who won the first Test, toiled in the field, their only other success coming in the morning when fast bowler Amir bowled Alex Hales for 10 with a rapid full-pitched delivery.Cook and Root carried the hosts to 95 for one at lunch and the skipper reached his 29th Test hundred shortly before tea, reward for a typically composed innings.The left-hander mixed watchful defence with crisp drives and cuts which brought him 15 fours before Amir produced a ball that kept low and crashed into his stumps off the bottom of the bat.Root sweetly straight-drove his second delivery from Rahat Ali to the boundary and also looked in good form after his recent barren patch, hitting 12 fours all around the ground.Pakistan lead the four-match series 1-0 after their 75-run win in the first Test at Lord's last week.'",7/22/16,Cook century lifts England to 210 2 at,,,2293,"MANCHESTER: Alastair Cook and Joe Root overcame the early loss of Alex Hales to leave England well-placed on 95 for one at lunch on the first day of the second Test against Pakistan at Old Trafford on Friday.Cook, who marked his 50th Test as England captain by winning the toss, was 40 not out and Root unbeaten on 41, with the hosts looking to bounce back from losing last week's first Test at Lord's.England's second-wicket partnership was so far worth 70 runs after Hales was bowled by a superb Mohammad Amir delivery for 10.Predictably, there were a few jeers as Amir prepared to bowl the first ball of the match.Amir, who took the last wicket in Pakistan's win in the first of this four-Test series, saw his first and second deliveries edged through gully for four by Cook.Amir, one of three left-arm quicks in Pakistan's attack with Rahat and Wahab Riaz, had Hales dropped in the gully on six by Asad Shafiq, the ball speeding away to third man for four.But three balls later, having repeatedly moved the ball away from Hales, Amir skilfully swung the ball back into the right-handed opener.The delivery also cut off the seam a touch and knocked over Hales's middle and off stumps. England were now 25 for one after seven overs.Leg-spinner Yasir Shah, England's tormentor-in-chief at Lord's with 10 wickets, saw his second ball Friday cut in front of point by Root for four. That shot brought up England's fifty in 92 balls with 10 boundaries.Root, in the manner of Yorkshire and England great Geoffrey Boycott, forced both Wahab Riaz and Amir through cover-point off the back foot for fours as he and his skipper looked to make the most of an even-paced pitch in sunny conditions ideal for batting.''

close of play, the West Indies lost Rajendra Chandrika to a catch at the wicket off Mohammed Shami, leaving opening partner Kraigg Brathwaite and nightwatchman Devendra Bishoo to resume on the third morning at 31 for one.On another day of generally fruitless toil for the West Indies, Kohli extended his batting masterclass from the first day for another two hours, adding another 57 runs to reach exactly 200 just before the lunch interval.He became the first Indian captain to score a Test double-century away from home.Any expectation of more of the virtuoso performance was ended off the second delivery upon the resumption when he played on to the persevering and previously unlucky Shannon Gabriel.Kohli's innings spanned just over six hours and was embellished by 24 fours off 283 deliveries.Dropped on 43 by new wicketkeeper Shane Dowrich off Gabriel in the morning session, Ashwin played the supporting role to his captain in a 168-run fifth-wicket stand that drained the enthusiasm from the home side before lunch.However Kohli's surprise demise put the focus squarely on the all-rounder and he made the most of the promotion to number six in the batting order for the first time in his Test career, reaching three figures just before tea with a boundary off the tiring leg-spinner Bishoo.He got good support from wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha, who contributed

Second-placed India (112) are breathing down Australia's neck with just six points separating the two teams. Pakistan are third on 111, while England lie fourth, on 108 points. To keep a hold on the top spot, Australia need at least a 1-0 win over Sri Lanka, and need England to beat Pakistan in at least one Test.For India to pip Australia, however, they will need to beat West Indies 4-0 and hope the England-Pakistan series ends in a draw and also Sri Lanka wins by 1-0 or a better margin.Pakistan can claim the top spot for the first time in history if they beat England and Sri Lanka beats Australia.For England, it seems a bit of an uphill climb as, they will need to beat Pakistan in the remaining three Tests, apart from needing West Indies to beat India in at least one Test.

Mohammad Hafeez was 24 not out and Younis Khan 12 not out.Left-handed opener Masood fell to Anderson for the sixth time in Tests when he edged the paceman straight to England captain Alastair Cook at first slip.Anderson, returning to Test cricket after missing Pakistan's 75-run win in the series opener at Lord's with a shoulder injury, then had Azhar plumb lbw as the batsman aimed across the line to leave Pakistan 25 for two.They should have been 32 for three when Younis, then on three, edged all-rounder Ben Stokes only for the normally reliable Cook to drop a seemingly routine two-handed slip chance.Earlier, Cook (76 not out) and Joe Root (71 not out) took England to 173 for one in their second innings before the skipper declared.England, already with a huge lead of 489 runs, resumed on 98 for one after Cook had decided against enforcing the follow-on on Sunday.Cook, who scored 105 in England's mammoth first innings 589 for eight declared, was 49 not out and vice-captain Root, whose Test-best 254 was the cornerstone of that total, 23 not out.Left-handed opener Cook cover-drove Rahat Ali for the seventh boundary of his innings to complete a 55-ball fifty. It was his fastest in Tests, surpassing a 56-ball effort against India in Mohali in 2008.Root struck three legside fours in four balls from left-arm quick Rahat before another boundary, a slog-sweep off leg-spinner Yasir Shah, took him to a 38-ball fifty.Root's 10th four, a reverse sweep off Azhar, saw England's second-wicket duo complete a century partnership. The stand was worth 105 in 85 balls when Cook called a halt after he and Root had added 75 runs in just nine overs on Monday.Shah, who took 10 wickets at Lord's, finished with second-innings figures of none for 53 in nine overs following his first-innings return of one for 213 in 56 overs.

They have played lot of games for New South Wales and they are close friends. It's going to be exciting,"" Smith told reporters in Pallekele, on the outskirts of Kandy.Australia have hired local spin legend Muttiah Muralitharan as a consultant for the series, well aware of Sri Lanka's reputation for producing turning pitches.Smith said that cracks had already appeared on the Pallekele strip which should also benefit Sri Lanka's premier spinner Rangana Herath.""The wicket will take spin for sure here. Not sure about the first innings, but it looks very dry and lots of cracks on it. It certainly will help spin bowlers,"" Smith added.""They (Sri Lanka) have some quality spinners in their rank led by Rangana Herath. He has done really well in these conditions. The batters need to have some good plans against him at what he is going to bring at us.""Smith confirmed that vice-captain David Warner will play after being sidelined for six weeks with a broken

off-spin great Saqlain Mushtaq is set for another spell as an England coaching consultant, highlighting how fluid national allegiances can become when a cricketer's playing days are over.Saqlain was brought in by England ahead of the recent second Test against Pakistan at Old Trafford.In the build-up he found himself working with both off-spinner Moeen Ali and leg-break bowler Adil Rashid, although only Ali of the pair made it into the XI that won by 330 runs with more than a day to spare to level the four-match series at 1-1.Saqlain's former Pakistan team-mate Mushtaq Ahmed, is carrying out a similar role with the tourists in more of a permanent capacity.Prior to taking up his Pakistan role, former leg-spinner Mushtaq was England's spin-bowling coach.Off-spin legend Muttiah Muralitharan, Test cricket's all-time leading wicket-taker, has come under fire for working with Australia in their ongoing series in his native Sri Lanka.By contrast the atmosphere between English and Pakistani officials has been far more cordial.That's partly because, as this is Pakistan's first tour of England since their infamous 2010 spot-fixing debacle at Lord's, both sides are desperate to let their cricket do the talking.It is also a reflection of their multi-national backroom staffs, with England head coach Trevor Bayliss an Australian and his Pakistan counterpart, Mickey Arthur, a South African.Added to all that, Pakistan fielding coach Steve Rixon, the former Australia wicket-keeper, and Bayliss -- who made his name internationally as Sri Lanka coach -- were once team-mates in

Club.Williamson will become New Zealand's 29th Test captain when he leads the Black Caps out on Thursday, taking over from Brendon McCullum following his retirement from the international game in February.McCullum was credited with turning around New Zealand's fortunes and image over his last three years as captain, when he led them to the final of the 50-over World Cup and adopted a popular, attacking outlook.Under his watch, New Zealand drew just three of their last 21 Test matches, and one of their last 12.Williamson promised to carry on that legacy, but said that the nature of the Queens pitch may force him to adopt alternative fields to what fans are used to seeing from the Black Caps.""We're certainly going to play in a way that gives us the best chance to win, which is what we do every time we go out in a Test match,"" he said on Wednesday.""How 'attacking' looks on some of these surfaces may be different, it may not be four slips and two gullies because there might be no point in doing that.""You don't tend to get the pace and bounce that you do in other parts of the world which can help bowlers take wickets, so you have to try and skin it another way.""Zimbabwe have not played a Test match since losing a series 3-0 to Bangladesh in November 2014, but New Zealand have not forgotten the last time that they met in Bulawayo, when the hosts threatened to chase down a target of 366 and lost by just 34 runs.As such, New Zealand will not be taking the home side lightly.""They know these conditions better than anyone so we are expecting a tough challenge,""

building up an 86-run first innings lead over their hosts as they took firm command Wednesday of a low-scoring Test in Pallekele.Perera fell to the last ball of the day, with the umpires once again forced to call a premature halt to proceedings following a downpour at the picturesque ground on the outskirts of Kandy.Australia were all out for 203 in reply to Sri Lanka's first innings total of 117, with spinner Lakshan Sandakan taking four wickets on his debut.The early loss of Perera on the second day of the first Test was another bitter blow for the struggling hosts.Perera fell for just four when he was lbw to paceman Mitchell Starc, leaving Sri Lanka wobbling on six for one at close of play.The downpour initially prompted the umpires to call an early tea break, but they were later forced to abandon play early for the second day running.Veteran Sri Lankan left-arm spinner Rangana Herath and the 25-year-old rookie Sandakan had earlier taken four wickets apiece as the Australian batsman also struggled to cope with a turning pitch.Adam Voges top-scored for the Australians with 47, meaning no player from either side managed to score a half-century in the first innings.And with the pitch showing no sign of respite, the Australians' first innings lead could well prove decisive as they try to cement their position as Test cricket's number one side.The 38-year-old Herath, who has hinted that he may soon retire from Test cricket, was the pick of the bowlers and was unlucky not to record a five-wicket haul.He dismissed both overnight batsmen -- skipper Steve Smith and Usman Khawaja -- in successive overs and had a third wicket in the morning session when wicketkeeper Peter Nevill was caught at mid-on.While Herath was providing captain Angelo Mathews both the attacking and containing options, Sandakan ran through the lower order to finish with four for 58.Seamer Nuwan Pradeep finished with two wickets, including that of the resolute Voges who was brilliantly caught by Kusal Mendis at gully.Voges, who faced 115 deliveries and hit three fours, added 60 for the fifth wicket with Mitchell Marsh, who was among Sandakan's victims.'",7/27/16,Rain abandon play early as

There have been previous attempts to popularise the sport through games involving retired international stars, playing at baseball venues, but Russell believes the demographics mean there is no real need to convert Americans to the sport.""As well as the Caribbean diaspora, you have the Asian population here who are cricket-starved,"" he added.While no plans for the future have been announced it is unlikely that this week's games, featuring all six franchises, will be the last time that the CPL features at Lauderhill.""We have invested well over a million dollars in coming to Florida.

earlier, responded with an electrifying innings of 62 with four sixes and seven fours off 62 deliveries to lift the home side from the depths of seven for three.He completely dominated a fourth-wicket partnership of 81 with Marlon Samuels and offered the sparse opening-day crowd at Sabina Park rich entertainment with a succession of attacking shots off both pacers and spinners.However, his adventurous style always made him vulnerable and he fell in the final over before the interval, adjudged leg-before to Ravichandran Ashwin.Samuels, who was scoreless for 29 deliveries -- in stark contrast to the explosive batting of his fellow Jamaican at the other end -- resumes in the afternoon session on 14 off 71 balls in partnership with Roston Chase.West Indies were made to regret captain Jason Holder's decision to bat first on winning the toss as India's opening bowlers exploited the vulnerability of the hosts' top order yet again.Ishant Sharma removed Kraigg Brathwaite and Darren Bravo off successive deliveries in just his second over.With a reputation of susceptibility to the short ball early in his innings clearly on the fast bowler's mind, Brathwaite failed to negotiate a lifting delivery in Sharma's second over and Cheteshwar Pujara held the simple catch at short-leg.Bravo's weakness outside the off-stump was then immediately capitalised upon, the left-hander failing to cover a full-length delivery properly for a delighted Indian captain Virat Kohli to take the catch at first slip.Rajendra Chandrika, the other opener, then gave catching practice to Lokesh Rahul at second slip as he guided a lifting delivery from Mohammed Shami unerringly into the hands of the fielder.Rahul was an enforced change to the Indian lineup from the first

helped the hosts recover to 121 for five at the close of day three at Queens Sports Club, but Zimbabwe still need 291 runs to make New Zealand bat again in the match.While the first two days of the game had been distinctly one-sided, the third was even more brutal as Taylor and Watling added 253 for the sixth wicket for New Zealand, who went on to claim four Zimbabwean wickets in the first four overs of their reply.The Black Caps lost nightwatchman Ish Sodhi in the second over of the day as they resumed on 315 for four, but that simply allowed Taylor and Watling to get on with their productive alliance.The pair hardly offered the Zimbabweans a sniff in the four hours that they were together, as Taylor brought up his 14th Test hundred and Watling registered his sixth.They were finally parted five overs after the tea break when Watling pulled a short delivery to deep square-leg, and the dismissal led Kane Williamson to declare with a first-innings lead of 412.The New Zealand bowlers wasted no time in getting stuck into their opponents, as Tim Southee had Hamilton Masakadza caught at slip in the first over and Boult went on the rampage.The left-armer bowled Brian Chari in his first over, then dismissed Chamu Chibhabha and Prince Masvaure with consecutive deliveries in his second.Ervine and Sikandar Raza Butt responded with an entertaining counterattack that saw them put on 69 for the fifth wicket in just nine overs, but Neil Wagner ended the fun when he dismissed Raza for 37 with a short ball.The Zimbabweans were left staring down the barrel of an innings defeat,

the focus began to shift to when captain Kane Williamson might declare and begin New Zealand's push for victory.The Black Caps lost nightwatchman Ish Sodhi in the second over of the day as they resumed on 315 for four, but that simply allowed Taylor and Watling to get on with their productive alliance.Taylor started the day on 38 and reached 87 by the lunch interval, while Watling was untroubled throughout his innings and scored progressively quicker as the day wore on.As Zimbabwe wilted in the field, the pair added 120 runs in the second session without offering a chance.The hosts were not helped by the continued absence of Sean Williams and Regis Chakabva through illness.Without Williams' left-arm spin, legspinner Graeme Cremer was left to wheel his way through 51

Steven Smith posted a gritty half-century before Steve O'Keefe and Peter Nevill frustrated Sri Lanka with a 178-ball partnership.Herath bagged the last Australian wicket to fall by cleaning up O'Keefe to trigger wild celebration in the Lankan camp. This was Sri Lanka's only second Test win against Australia in 27 matches.It was batsman Mendis (176) who set up the unlikely win for Sri Lanka with his superb maiden ton in his team's second innings after the hosts overcame an 86-run deficit.The 21-year-old Mendis, the only centurion in a low-scoring contest, played a memorable 254-ball knock laced with 21 fours and a six.For Lankan spinners it was a race against time as rain threatened to thwart their chances of upsetting firm favourites Australia but Herath had other ideas in mind.  The left-arm spinner, who grabbed four wickets in the first innings, made life miserable for the Australian batsmen on a turning track on the fifth morning.Smith, whose 55 was the next best after Mendis' century, was trapped LBW by Herath as Australia slipped to 141 for seven at lunch.Debutant chinaman bowler Lakshan Sandakan, who bagged seven wickets in the match, provided the perfect foil to Herath's experience.O'Keefe, who was ruled out of the remainder of the series after injuring his hamstring Thursday, surprised the opposition by turning up at the crease Saturday.O'Keefe and Nevill resisted stoutly with one eye on the skies but could only delay the inevitable.Sri Lanka lead the three-match series 1-0 as the action shifts to Galle for the second Test beginning August 4.'",7/30/16,Sri Lanka stun top ranked Australia by 106 ru,,,2356,LONDON: Prospects of day/night Test cricket being staged in England moved closer to reality on Friday with a trial announced by Warwickshire next month.,7/30/16,DayNight Test in England moves closer with tri,,,2357,"LONDON: With one month of the transfer window left remaining, Premier League clubs are poised to push escalating fees closer to another new record this week.BROADCASTING DEAL",7/31/16,Premier League transfer fees poised to break record,,,2358,"TORONTO: Novak Djokovic maintained his unbeaten record against Frenchman Gael Monfils with a 6-3 6-2 win in the semi-finals of the Rogers Cup in Toronto on Saturday, while Japan's Kei Nishikori also reached the final after beating Swiss second seed Stan Wawrinka.",7/31/16,Djokovic continues Monfils mastery Nishikori wi,,,2359,"BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe: New Zealand wrapped up an innings victory against Zimbabwe in the first Test in Bulawayo on Sunday despite a maiden Test century from Sean Williams finally giving the hosts something to smile about.New Zealand bowled Zimbabwe out for 295 to win the game by an innings and 117 runs, with left-arm seamer Neil Wagner finishing with eight wickets in the match at Queens Sports Club.The second and final Test gets under way at the same venue on Saturday.After three days of brutal domination at the hands of the tourists, Williams rose from his sick bed to hit the fastest Test century by a Zimbabwean as he reached three figures in just 106 deliveries.The left-hander had spent the past two days off the field due to illness as New Zealand racked up a first-innings lead of 412, and came to the crease early on the fourth morning with Zimbabwe tottering on 124 for six, still needing 288 runs to make the Black Caps bat again.Williams added 118 for the seventh wicket with captain Graeme Cremer, who made 33, and went on to make 119 before succumbing to the left-arm spin of Mitchell Santner.'",7/31/16,New Zealand thrash Zimbabwe to win first T,,,2360,"ISLAMABAD: 'The annual Shandur polo festival concluded on Sunday at world s highest polo ground in Chitral.Addressing on the occasion the senior officials of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government said that the provincial government in collaboration with Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC) was making all out efforts to promote sports and tourism while polo game will find special attention and patronage of the KPK government.He said the polo grounds of the major towns of the district including Garum Chashma, Booni, Shagram Reshun will be reconstructed and polo players will get special package from the government so that the game of kings is revived in Chitral which ultimately promotes tourism.The three-day famous Shandoor polo festival had started on Friday (July 29) in Chitral.Shandoor Polo Festival is one of the big festivals in the country.The polo which is played between the polo teams of Gilgit-Baltistan and Chitral Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is experienced as a free'style polo match.The festival also includes Folk music Folk dance traditional sports.Polo was introduced in South Asia by the Muslim kings in the 13th century.English word Polo is in fact a Balti word meaning ball .In ancient times there was no limit to the number of players and no time limit.

Jamaica: West Indies captain Jason Holder earned a richly-deserved wicket at the end of an excellent spell of bowling, but India remained firmly in control at 425 for six at lunch on the third day of the second Test at Sabina Park in Jamaica on Monday.That gave the tourists a lead of 229 runs after the home side's meagre first innings total of 196.Ajinkya Rahane survived a searching examination from medium-pacer Holder and benefitted from a dropped chance off leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo to be unbeaten on 74 at the interval.However the West Indies finally enjoyed a bit of success for their discipline and persistence with the ball when wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha was ruled leg-before to Holder for 47 on the stroke of the interval.Their sixth-wicket partnership was worth 98 runs and further solidified India's already dominant position in the match, even though they were again kept to a pedestrian scoring rate with only 67 runs added in the two hours of play.Holder, who had gone wicketless through 54 overs in the series, troubled Rahane consistently in a nine-over spell after replacing fast bowler Shannon Gabriel 40 minutes into the session.In one particularly testing over, he had three vehement LBW appeals turned down and twice beat the outside edge of the well-set batsman.Bishoo should have claimed a wicket at the other end but Rajendra Chandrika failed to hold on to a low diving effort at backward-point when Rahane, on 65, top-edged an attempted cut.A weather forecast of torrential rain on the fourth day suggests that the Indians may be inclined to pursue

reached 500 for nine declared at tea on the third day, the hosts go into the afternoon session still facing a deficit of 256 runs to avoid a second consecutive innings defeat in the four-match series.Frustrated by a weather system that erased the final session on day three and delayed the start of play on the fourth morning for over an hour, India's varied attack made up for the lost time by again exploiting the glaring weaknesses of the West Indies batsmen.With his place in the team on the line after a succession of low scores in his fledgling Test career, Rajendra Chandrika was the first to go, bowled for one by a delivery that made extra height from tall fast bowler Ishant Sharma and rebounded off the batsman's right elbow onto the stumps as he attempted to pull out of the shot.His opening partner, Kraigg Brathwaite, and new batsman Darren Bravo were peppered with regular short-pitched bowling from both Sharma and Mohammed Shami.Bravo in particular was lucky to survive the concerted assault but at the other end, the introduction of Amit Mishra broke the 36-run stand when Brathwaite, on 23, miscued an attempted pull off the leg-spinner for Lokesh Rahul to take the catch running back from midwicket.Marlon Samuels was comprehensively bowled by Shami with no addition to the total and off what proved to be the last delivery before the interval, Bravo failed to negotiate another lifting delivery angled into the body and Rahul held the catch at third slip to remove the left-hander for 20.In losing three wickets for seven runs at the end of the truncated session, in which only 15.5 overs were bowled, the West Indies exactly replicated their predicament at the start of the match when their captain, Jason Holder, won the toss and chose to bat

Masood in particular has had a tough time against James Anderson, falling to the pacer six times in 57 balls since the two teams' met in the United Arab Emirates last year.Naturally, Mickey Arthur, the Pakistan coach, called for a better effort from his top-order batsmen but was tight-lipped about possible changes to the side.

But Shah, bowling into the rough outside leg stump, had his revenge when Root, not for the first time this season, mistimed a sweep and gave a simple catch to Hafeez at short fine leg.Vince, yet to make a fifty in nine Test innings, had been composed in equalling his highest score at this level of 42.

""I was asked by my federation to come to the Olympics and I was very happy to do so -- for me, it's the most important competition in the world.""The decision to include professionals at the Olympics only came in June and was met with a chorus of disapproval.Only three professionals including Tommasone made it to Rio.'",8/6/16,Easy win for first boxing pro in Games history,,,2418,"BULAWAYO: Opener Tom Latham scored his second consecutive century in Zimbabwe as New Zealand's batsmen dominated the opening day of the second Test at Queens Sports Club on Saturday.Latham's 105 set New Zealand up for a mammoth total and crushing victory in the first Test, and he bettered that score to give the Black Caps a commanding platform.The 24-year-old recorded his fifth Test century and went on to make 136, before succumbing to what proved to be the final ball of the day as New Zealand closed on 329 for two.Zimbabwe's bowlers claimed just six wickets in a horribly one-sided first Test, and endured a similarly frustrating day on another docile pitch on Saturday.With the seamers lacking in pace, Latham and Martin Guptill had no trouble seeing off the new ball and went on to construct an opening stand of 169.Guptill was eventually dismissed in the hour before tea when Donald Tiripano snuck a straight delivery through his defences to trap him lbw for 87.But any joy for Zimbabwe was short-lived, as Latham went on to add 160 for the second wicket with Kane Williamson.Latham failed to see out the day when he was caught and bowled by left-arm spinner Sean Williams, but Williamson went to stumps unbeaten on 95, within touching distance of becoming the first New Zealand batsman to score a century against all nine Test nations.The day also saw Zimbabwe's fans stage a peaceful protest against President Robert Mugabe's government when they rose as one at the end of the 36th over to sing the national anthem.The number signified the number of years that Mugabe has been in power, and the action was initiated by the #ThisFlag citizen movement that has brought stayaways and public demonstrations across the country over the past six weeks.

After the interval, Root pulled leg-spinner Shah for a boundary that saw him to a 108-ball fifty with his sixth four.Vince followed up with a fine leg glance for four off Shah.Sohail, altering his line, almost got Root to play on.But it was Shah, bowling into the rough outside leg stump, who made the breakthrough.Root, not for the first time this season, mistimed a sweep and gave a simple catch to Hafeez at short fine leg.Root's exit ended a stand of 95 in 36 overs with Vince that had taken England to 221 for three.Vince, yet to make a fifty in nine Test innings, had been composed in equalling his highest score at this level of 42.But he too fell in familiar fashion when, flirting outside off stump against the new ball, he guided Amir to second slip Younis with the kind of shot usually reserved for coaches giving fielding practice.",8/6/16,Yasir Shah strikes as England lose R,,,2420,"BULAWAYO: Hundreds of protestors waved Zimbabwe's national flag and sang the national anthem during a cricket match against New Zealand on Saturday, in a sign of mounting opposition to President Robert Mugabe.Circumventing laws which forbid political gatherings without police clearance, protestors at the ground in Bulawayo, the country's second largest city, rose at the 36th over and began singing the national anthem while waving the national flag,which has been turned into a symbol of protest.""I am in complete support of the protest because of the situation in the country,"" activist Mandla Dungeni told AFP.""We need to get the message across that it's time up, using whatever means available to us.

The demonstration was dispersed by mounted police.After 36 years of Mugabe's authoritarian rule, Zimbabwe has seen a rise in opposition protests fuelled by internet activism using the hashtag ""ThisFlag"" - a reference to wearing the national flag in public.On Wednesday hundreds of protestors held a march in the capital calling on 92-year-old Mugabe to step down over worsening economic troubles which have seen banks running short of cash and the government failing to pay its workers on time.Three weeks ago, Zimbabwe's independence war veterans, who had been loyal allies of Mugabe, issued a strongly-worded statement calling on him to step down.Despite his advanced age, the president has fought back, vowing to crack down on leaders of the protests.The ruling party on Thursday expelled four war veterans suspected to be behind the criticism.'",8/6/16,Zimbabweans against government and cricket match against New Zealand,,,2421,"BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe: Opening batsman Tom Latham closed in on his second consecutive century in Zimbabwe as New Zealand made a dominant start to the second Test in Bulawayo on Saturday.Latham was unbeaten on 78 as New Zealand went to tea on the opening day on 206 for one after they won the toss and elected to bat.The left-hander scored 105 in the first Test, which New Zealand won by an innings and 117 runs, and continued that good form on the first day of the second and final Test.With Zimbabwe's pace-shy seamers failing to threaten on a placid pitch, Latham put on an opening partnership of 169 with Martin Guptill, who made 87.The hosts finally made a breakthrough in the hour before tea, when Donald Tiripano snuck a delivery through Guptill's defences to trap him lbw.The only other drama on the opening day saw Zimbabwe's fans stage a peaceful protest against President Robert Mugabe's government when they rose as one at the end of the 36th over to sing the national anthem.The action was an initiative of the #ThisFlag citizen movement that has brought stayaways and public demonstrations across the country over the past six weeks.

But restaurants in Italy came out best on value for money.Savoy's restaurant in la Monnaie, the old French national mint on the Left Bank of the River Seine, is famous for its artichoke soup with black truffle and filo pastry mushroom brioche and ""cold steamed"" blue lobster. His 18-course ""Innovations and Inspirations"" menu costs 490 euros ($520) without wine.It was the top-rated French restaurant last year coming in fourth place in the La Liste, which was set up as a ""more scientific and reliable"" rival to the British-based 50 Best Restaurants ranking.Savoy -- who trained the volcanic British chef Gordon Ramsay and remains his mentor -- controversially did not make the 50 Best this year. Nor did Kenichiro Nishi of Kyo Aji, whom La Liste called ""the undisputed master of kaiseki"", the traditional multi-course Japanese dinner.French-born Ripert, 51, a Buddhist who picked up his Emmys for his PBS show ""Avec Eric"", already holds the maximum three Michelin stars.La Liste bills itself as a ""guide of the guides"", pulling together reviews from almost 400 guide books, newspapers and online sites from TripAdvisor to the New York Times and the prestigious Michelin rankings. But tragedy struck the first winner Franco-Swiss chef Benoit Violier, who killed himself a month after winning for the Hotel de Ville at Crissier near Lausanne in Switzerland.Savoy, 63, a three-Michelin-starred chef, comes from humble origins. His father was a municipal gardener in the small town of Bourgoin-Jailleu near Lyon in eastern France where his mother ran a fast-food ""buvette"".He later trained as a chocolate maker before being taken on as an apprentice by the legendary Troisgros brothers for their restaurant in nearby Roanne.La Liste's founder Philippe Faure, the head of the French tourist board, has accused the 50 Best of consistently ""denigrating"" French restaurants in its listing.While 50 Best has repeatedly denied the charge, no French restaurants have made its top 10 for the last few years.Faure said his listing was compiled impartially from a rigorous mathematical analysis of hundreds of guides and thousands of reviews.La Liste has now also launched a smartphone application in six languages aimed at international travellers for its 1,000 top-rated restaurants in the world, plus the 10,000 eateries which its analysis found to be the best value.'",11/30/16,Paris restaurant best in world but Japanese chefs come out,,,2529,TOKYO: Asian stocks edged higher on Wednesday reflecting upbeat U.S. growth news while oil steadied after a sharp drop overnight as OPEC struggled to agree on a glut-draining production cut.,11/30/16,Asia stocks edge up on US growth data cues dollar steady,,,2530,"ISLAMABAD/BEIJING: Pakistan and China embarked on their ambitious and effective project to link China's southwestern province Yunnan with Pakistan's largest port in Karachi, on Wednesday.

with long queues materialising outside banks across the country as people tried to get rid of their old notes -- some 86 percent of all bills in circulation -- ahead of next week's deadline.On Monday
