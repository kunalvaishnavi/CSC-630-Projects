# CSC 630 Projects by Kunal Vaishnavi

This repository hosts all of my visualizations from the entire course. Go to this [link](https://kunalvaishnavi.github.io/CSC-630-Projects) to see them.

The layout for this entire repository is taken from Dr. Z's visualization site [template](https://github.com/nzufelt/viz_site_template).

Note that due to GitHub's restrictions on file sizes, some of the original datasets are not uploaded. I have uploaded them to Kaggle.
