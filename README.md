# CSC 630 Projects by Kunal Vaishnavi

This repository hosts all of my visualizations from the entire course. Go to this [link](https://kunalvaishnavi.github.io/CSC-630-Projects) to see them.

The layout for this entire repository is taken from Dr. Z's visualization site [template](https://github.com/nzufelt/viz_site_template).

Note #1: Due to GitHub's restrictions on file sizes, some of the original datasets are not uploaded. I have uploaded them [here](https:kaggle.com/kunalvaishnavi/csc-630-datasets) on Kaggle.
Note #2: There is a weird bug with the displayment of the maps project. When you first open it, it shows the dots that represent the cities to appear behind the U.S. map but once you reload the page, it appears in front of the U.S. map, as it normally does.
Note #3: For some reason, GitHub pages isn't working 100% for me. So, any updates that I've put into my projects are not appearing at the link that shows all of my visualizations.
