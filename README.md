# CSC 630 Projects by Kunal Vaishnavi

This repository hosts all of my visualizations from the entire course. Go to this [link](https://kunalvaishnavi.github.io/CSC-630-Projects) to see them.

The layout for this entire repository is taken from Dr. Z's visualization site [template](https://github.com/nzufelt/viz_site_template).

Note #1: Due to GitHub's restrictions on file sizes, some of the original datasets are not uploaded. I have uploaded them [here](https://kaggle.com/kunalvaishnavi/csc-630-datasets) on Kaggle.

Note #2: There is a weird bug with the displayment of the maps project. When you first open it, sometimes it shows the dots that represent the cities to appear behind the U.S. map. But once you reload the page, it appears in front of the U.S. map, as it normally does.
